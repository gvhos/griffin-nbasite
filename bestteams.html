                <span class="fact-number">1970s:</span>
                <img src="https://trophylives.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wilt-chamberlain.jpg?w=640" alt="Lakers" class="fact-image">
                <h3 class="fact-title">1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers</h3>
                <p>The 71-72 Lakers were one of the original “superteams” in the NBA. Led by Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West, the Lakers dominated every team in their path during the regular season. They won an NBA-record 33 straight games, finishing 69-13. Forwards Gail Goodrich and Happy Hairston were the perfect complementary pieces to put next to Chamberlain and West, with the duo averaging 25.9 and 13.1 PPG, respectively. </p>
				<p>Just like in the regular season, the Lakers dominated their competition during the playoffs. They swept the Chicago Bulls in the first round, before running through the Bucks 4-2 in the Eastern Conference semifinals. The NBA Finals weren’t any different, where Los Angeles took down a talented Knicks team led by Walt Frazier and Willis Reed in just 5 games.</p>

                <span class="fact-number">1980s:</span>
                <img src="https://cdn.nba.com/manage/2021/07/76ers-1983-072821-1568x882.jpg" alt="76ers" class="fact-image">
                <h3 class="fact-title">1982-83 Philadelphia 76ers</h3>
                <p>The 82-83 76ers had it all. Led by stars Julius Erving (21.4 PPG) and Moses Malone (24.5 PPG), the Sixers also had some incredible role players in Maurice Cheeks (12.5 PPG) and Bobby Jones (9.0 PPG). Add in “The Boston Strangler,” Andrew Toney, and it’s easy to see why Billy Cunnigham’s squad was widely regarded as one of the most dominant teams of the decade. </p>
				<p>Before the 1983 playoffs, Moses Malone made a bold prediction, claiming the Sixers would win each of their playoff series in “Fo, Fo, Fo” games. He was almost right, as Philadelphia only lost one game the entire playoffs in one of the most dominant runs ever. Ultimately, the 82-83 Sixers dominance should not be forgotten.</p>

            <div class="history-fact" style="background-color: #DD1D4D">
                <span class="fact-number">1990s:</span>
                <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*7cxs4OS8GJJorSahpNMr2A.jpeg" alt = "Bulls" class="fact-image">
                <h3 class="fact-title">1995-96 Chicago Bulls</h3>
                <p>There are a lot of Bulls teams in the ‘90s I could choose from, but I definitely think the 1995-96 squad is the best iteration of the team. Led by arguably the GOAT in Michael Jordan, Chicago won a then-record 72 games during the regular season. Jordan—at the peak of his powers—averaged a league-leading 30.4 PPG alongside Scottie Pippen, who played excellent defense on a nightly basis and added nearly 20 PPG of his own.</p>
				<p>As you’d expect, the Bulls were quite dominant in the playoffs, just like during the regular season. They dismantled the Heat, Knicks, and Magic relatively easily, before facing off against a 64-18 juggernaut Seattle SuperSonics team in the Finals. The Sonics were no match for the Bulls, though, and Chicago won 4-2, culminating arguably the best season ever.</p>

                <img src="https://lakersdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/USATSI_5346978_168403910_lowres-2-e1726693032477-860x543.jpg" alt="Lakers" class="fact-image">
                <h3 class="fact-title">2000-01 Los Angeles Lakers</h3>
                <p>When asked about the best duos ever, Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal probably come to most sports fan’s minds, and for good reason. The two were electric in their 8 seasons together, winning three consecutive championships. 2001 was when the two were at their best together, averaging a combined 57.2 PPG and leading the Lakers to a championship.</p>
				<p>The 2000-01 Lakers might’ve had the best playoff run ever, dropping only one game over the course of multiple months. They obliterated the Western Conference, sweeping the Trail Blazers, Kings, and Spurs on their way to the NBA Finals against the Sixers. Philadelphia took game 1 with Allen Iverson’s iconic step over, but the Lakers responded by winning the next 4 contests. </p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">2016-17 Golden State Warriors</h3>
                <p>Fresh off of signing Kevin Durant in one of the most controversial free agent decisions ever, many people expected the Warriors to dominate the entire league. They were definitely right. The Warriors superteam, led by Steph Curry, KD, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, finished the regular season with a 67-15 record.</p>
				<p>Unlike the team the year before that choked a 3-1 Finals lead, this Golden State squad went all the way, defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers in just 5 games. Kevin Durant and Steph Curry averaged 28.5 PPG and 28.1 PPG during the playoffs, respectively. Only losing once in the playoffs, the 2015-16 Warriors were an absolute force to be reckoned with because of their unreal amount of talent.</p>
