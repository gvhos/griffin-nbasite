                <h3 class="fact-title">Dallas Mavericks: Cooper Flagg (Duke)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">How have the Mavericks pulled this off? Three months removed from being the laughingstock of the NBA, the Mavs luck into the first overall pick with just a 1.8% chance. Thankfully for Dallas fans, Nico Harrison can’t mess this decision up, as Cooper Flagg is a slam dunk to be the first prospect off the board. The Duke freshman averaged 19.2 PPG on 48.1%/38.5%/84.0% shooting splits, along with incredible defense. Flagg’s fit next to Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis will be interesting, but he’ll definitely be an impactful rookie, regardless of his exact role. </p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">San Antonio Spurs: Dylan Harper (Rutgers)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Almost every NBA team would rush to take consensus #2 prospect Dylan Harper in this situation, however, San Antonio has a decision to make based on their current roster. The Spurs have a bunch of guards on their roster from De’Aaron Fox, to Stephon Castle, to Chris Paul. Could they bypass Harper and opt to select Ace Bailey or V.J. Edgecombe instead? Trade back? Ultimately, my guess is that the Spurs decide to select the best player available, which is Harper. </p>

                <img src="https://www.hoopshq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/GettyImages-2206262282.jpg?fit=1200%2C800" alt = "Sixers" class="fact-image">
                <h3 class="fact-title">Philadelphia 76ers: V.J. Edgecombe (Baylor)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">A lot of Sixers fans have their sights set on Ace Bailey at 3, but I think Baylor wing V.J. Edgecombe is the right pick for the team. Edgecombe’s a small at 6-5, but he makes up for his lack of size with elite athleticism and two-way ability. The 19-year-old put up 15.0 PPG last season in college, and unlike Bailey, he’s quite good at attacking the rim. Edgecombe would be my pick for sure, based on his feel for the game and athletic tools.</p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">Charlotte Hornets: Ace Bailey (Rutgers)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Ever since Danny Ainge took over as the Jazz President of Basketball Operations a couple of years ago, Utah has been building towards getting someone like Flagg. At 17-65, Utah finished with the worst record in the NBA last year, in large part because they want to draft a generational prospect. The NBA is a stars league, and Cooper Flagg would instantly lift the Jazz from a team with a murky outlook to one of the most exciting young squads.</p>

                <h3 class="fact-title"> Utah Jazz: Tre Johnson (Texas)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">The Jazz are undoubtedly frustrated after Monday’s NBA Draft Lottery, since they fell all the way to 5 after finishing with the worst record in the entire league. However, Utah can still walk away from the draft with a solid player, such as Texas’ Tre Johnson. Johnson is an elite shot creator that can comfortably knock down triples from NBA range. He led the SEC in scoring with 19.9 PPG, and he’d slot in nicely next to the Jazz young core.</p>

                <h3 class="fact-title"> Washington Wizards: Kon Knueppel (Duke)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">This may be a bit of a reach for Washington, but I think Kon Knueppel would be a really nice piece to add to Wizards roster. Knueppel has one of the highest floors in the entire draft, as he’s an elite three-point shooter that knocked down over 40% of his triples last year. Plus, Kon wouldn’t demand the ball too much, allowing Washington’s young guards like Bub Carrington to continue to develop.</p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">New Orleans Pelicans: Jeremiah Fears (Oklahoma)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">At 6-4, 182 pounds, Jeremiah Fears is a smaller prospect, but he doesn’t lack heart. The Oklahoma freshman scored 17.1 PPG and averaged 4.1 APG, leading his team to a solid 20-14 record. Fears would fit in nicely with the Pelicans, as they’re looking to a point guard to pair next to Zion Williamson long term. The concerns about Fears’ efficiency and shot-selection won’t go away anytime soon, but you could do a lot worse at pick 7.
