                <p>The NBA is an extremely storied league, with a bunch of all-time greats that have changed the game for the better. But with over 300 players in the Hall of Fame, it’s only natural that some former stars have been forgotten as time has gone on. In this article, I’ll attempt to give some of the little known Hall of Famers the respect they deserve.

                <h3>Bob Dandrige</h3>
                
                <p>Bob Dandridge was one of the NBA’s first draft steals. The Milwauke Bucks drafted the 6-6 forward out of Norfolk State in the fourth round of the 1969 NBA Draft. Dandridge wasted no time making an impact. In his rookie year, Bob averaged 13.2 PPG and 7.7 RPG, helping the Bucks to a 56-26 record in their second year in existence. </p>

                <p>Dandridge became an NBA champ in his second season, as he increased his scoring to 18.4 PPG on even better efficiency. The Norfolk State product would continue his dominance in the years to come. Throughout his 8 seasons as a Buck, Dandridge made two All-Star games and put up 18.8 PPG, while continuing to be an elite third option behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson. Dandrige’s best season, though, was in 1978-79 with the Washington Bullets, where he finished 5th in MVP voting and averaged over 20 a game. In an era dominated by elite centers, Dandridge sometimes got lost in the shuffle; however, his impact on the game should not be forgotten. A jack-of-all-trades offensive player and versatile defender, Dandridge was the ultimate team guy. </p>

                <h3>Zelmo Beaty</h3>
                
                <p>Zelmo Beaty often isn’t mentioned when discussing the best big men of the late 1960s and early 1970s, however the 6-9 center’s name should come up more often in those discussions. Often overshadowed because he played half his career in the ABA, Zelmo made 5 All-Star appearances between the two leagues and finished top 3 in MVP voting twice.</p>

                <p>Beaty was an extremely tough player and someone that every coach loved because he was willing to do whatever it took to win. Despite being undersized for his position, Beaty averaged double digit rebounds per game for most of his career, peaking in 1971 where he grabbed 15.7 RPG. That season, Beaty also scored 22.9 PPG and finished second in ABA MVP voting. Zelmo was also a force to be reckoned with on the defensive side of the ball. Both the ABA and NBA didn’t record blocks per game until the end of Beaty’s career, however there’s no doubt in my mind that he would’ve been near the top in the category at his peak. Beaty was deservedly inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016.</p>

                <h3>Connie Hawkins</h3>
                
                <p>A college scandal barred Connie Hawkins from playing in the NBA until his age-27 season, however, the 6-8 forward still had an illustrious career in the league. Before playing in the NBA, Hawkins spent two years in the ABA, where he put up 28.2 PPG and won the MVP in 1968. Once allowed in the NBA, Hawkins was incredible, making four straight All-Star teams with the Phoenix Suns.</p>

                <p>Hawkins was one of the most exciting stars in the NBA during his playing days, which makes sense since he was a playground legend in New York City. From acrobatic finishes, to high-flying dunks, to monster blocks, Hawkins had it all in his bag. Before he played in the NBA, Hawkins spent 3 seasons with Harlem Globetrotters, where he honed a lot of his tricks. Not only did Hawkins get inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1992, he also was named to the ABA All-Time Team in 1997. Regardless of where Connie Hawkins was playing basketball, one thing was for sure: he was going to make some plays you’d never seen before.=</p>
