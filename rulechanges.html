            <h2>NBA Rule Changes You Didn’t Know About</h2>
            
            <div class="article-meta" style="font-style: italic">
                Published: May 21, 2025 | Author: Griffin Bond
            </div>
            
            <p style="font-size: 1.05em">The NBA has an extensive rulebook, with over 50 articles of rules under 8 different sections. While everyone knows the main rules of basketball, such as traveling and fouls, some are a lot less known. Here are four historical NBA rule changes you probably haven’t heard about: </p>
            
            <div class="history-fact" style="background-color:indianred">
                <span class="fact-number">1</span>
                <img src="https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fae383f/2147483647/strip/false/crop/412x359+0+0/resize/412x359!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc8%2Fe2%2F81b884060094b2b2840154c038a0%2Fgoaltending.jpg" alt="Goaltend" class="fact-image">
                <h3 class="fact-title">Goaltending Becomes Illegal (1944/1956)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.07em">Today, most NBA fans know about goaltending, the rule that doesn’t allow players to block a shot when the ball is on the rim or falling into the basket. But before 1944, goaltending was allowed in the NBA. This meant that tall centers, such as George Mikan of the Minneapolis Lakers, could block a shot as the ball was going in. Mikan and the other giants of his era had a distinct advantage over the offensive players of the time before the change. After the NBA outlawed defensive goaltending in ‘44, offensive goaltending (now known as basket interference) got banned 12 years later. This change stopped players from knocking the ball in once it was already on the rim, a rule primarily enacted because of Wilt Chamberlain. Both goaltending rules are now staples of basketball, but they certainly weren’t always a thing.

                <img src="https://imagez.tmz.com/image/88/o/2024/04/11/8878bf20a85941108cef503a72dd36c2_md.jpg" alt="Mikan" class="fact-image">
                <h3 class="fact-title">Widening the lane (1951/1964)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.07em">George Mikan heavily influenced another rule change, as his dominance caused the NBA to widen the lane from 6 to 12 feet in 1951 and move it to 16 feet in 1964. Before, when the paint was very narrow, big men like Mikan would post up in the paint repeatedly and be fed the ball. In an effort to reduce their dominance, the NBA widened the lane, forcing centers to stand farther away from the hoop. This allowed for more parity in playing styles, as smaller guards now could impact the game in new ways. If the NBA never introduced the change to lane sizes, the game we love would look extremely different today.  </p>

            <div class="history-fact" style="background-color: #2870A9">
                <span class="fact-number">3</span>
                <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/02/28/sports/zone600.jpg" alt = "Zone defense" class="fact-image">
                <h3 class="fact-title">Illegal Defense Rule Changes (2001)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.07em">In the modern NBA, nearly every team plays zone defense at times, since it’s a great way to confuse opposing offenses. However, zone defense wasn’t always permitted in the NBA. Before 2000, the league banned teams from playing zone, in an effort to encourage one-on-one play. The illegal defense changes of 2001 switched this, allowing zone or trap defense, while introducing the defensive 3-second rule as a balancing measure. With more defensive schemes available, shrewd coaches could now double-team superstars such as Shaquille O’Neal or Tim Duncan easier. For everyone that complains about horrible defense in the NBA, consider how bad things would be if this rule change never happened.

                <img src="https://cdn1.sbnation.com/assets/4183869/57517449.jpg" alt="Hand-checking" class="fact-image">
                <h3 class="fact-title">Hand-Checking Ban (2004)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.07em">While the illegal defense changes benefited defenses, the ban on hand-checking moved some power the other way. All throughout the 20th century, NBA players could hand-check the offensive player with the ball, meaning they’d constantly be touching and bumping the ball-handler. It was extremely hard to create any separation, as defenders often abused the rule to limit movement. However, the 2004 rule change outlawed hand-checking above the free throw line, meaning defenders couldn’t use their hands to slow down opponents. This is definitely one reason guard scoring has increased over the last 20 years, with guys like Allen Iverson and Steve Nash rising to prominence in an era with no hand-checking. Can you imagine how hard it’d be for Steph Curry to score if hand-checking was allowed?</p>

             <div class="article-section conclusion" style="font-size: 1.07em">
                
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Ultimately, these rule changes weren’t the most influential ones ever. However, they all shaped the game we know today, despite many NBA fans being unaware that they ever existed.
