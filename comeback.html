            <div class="article-intro" style="font-size: 1.1em">
                <p>The second round of the 2024 NBA playoffs has been quite surprising, to say the least. Two teams heavily favored to win their series, the Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers, have fallen behind 0-2 in their respective series. Both the New York Knicks and Indiana Pacers deserve credit for their 2-0 advantages, but the Celtics and Cavs are definitely the better teams on paper. With that in mind, what do Boston and Cleveland need to do to even up these series? Do they have any chance? Here are my thoughts on the state of both Eastern Conference semifinal matchups:

</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- First section -->
            <div class="article-section">
                <h3>Celtics vs. Knicks</h3>
                
                <p>Games 1 and 2 of this series both felt eerily similar to me, especially once we reached the 4th quarter. In both contests, the Celtics jumped out to a commanding lead before crumbling in the final period. The Knicks—led by Clutch Player of The Year Jalen Brunson—have executed far better than Boston when it mattered most. Most recently, in game 2, the Celtics went nearly 8 minutes without scoring a field goal, allowing New York to mount a 20-point second half comeback. Boston has shot just 20% (9/45) from the field during the fourth quarter of the first 2 games in this series, compared to New York’s superior 20/44 mark.</p>
                
                
                <p>There’s a lot of things Joe Mazzula’s squad can do better down the stretch, but I believe their success will ultimately hinge on how well they can shoot the three-ball and how much they’ll rely on it. Despite being one of the NBA’s best three-point shooting teams in the regular season at 36.8%, Boston’s gone a combined 25/100 from deep versus New York so far this series. The accuracy is one thing, but the sheer amount of attempts the Celtics are shooting would scare me if I was a fan of the team. I think they’re over relying on the three, especially in crunch time, and they’d be better served attacking the rim in certain situations. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are two of the best slashers in the NBA. Why not leverage their driving ability to create more open shots? If the Celtics continue to struggle from three and cannot limit Jalen Brunson’s scoring, their playoff outlook doesn’t look good. </p>

            <!-- Second section -->
            <div class="article-section">
                <h3>Cavaliers vs. Pacers</h3>
                
                <p>I’m honestly not sure how this series is 2-0 to the Pacers. Indiana deserves credit, for sure, but game 2 was one of the biggest chokes by the Cavaliers I’ve even seen. Up 7 points with less than a minute left, Cleveland allowed Indiana to go on a 8-0 game-winning run, culminating with a ridiculous Tyrese Haliburton walk-off three. It’s not like the Cavs’ stars have been bad, either; Donovan Mitchell scored a whopping 48 points on 15-30 shooting game 2. Ultimately, the Pacers—similar to the Knicks—have just executed at a higher level than Cleveland in during the clutch. </p>

                <p>The first key to the Cavs coming back in this series is if they can limit the Pacer’s effectiveness from three-point range. Indiana shot 52.8% from deep in game 1 and 39.3% in game 2, continuing their regular season trend of above-average outside shooting (36.8% compared to 36.0% league average). Kenny Atkinson also needs to emphasize to his team the importance of getting back in transition; the Pacers played at the third fastest pace during the 2024-25 campaign. A silver lining for the Cavaliers is that I actually don’t think they’re in that bad of a spot on the offensive side of the ball. If Darius Garland and Evan Mobley are back from injury in game 3, Cleveland should have the offensive star power to overpower Indiana in the half-court. At the end of the day, though, I think it’s the Cavs defense that will make or break this series.

            <!-- Conclusion section -->
            <div class="article-section conclusion" style="font-size: 1.1em">
                
                <p>Down 2-0, both the Cavaliers and Celtics aren’t in great spots, however, I don’t think either of them are in a hopeless situation at the moment. If Boston can knock down the three-ball at a higher rate and Cleveland can tighten up their defense, a comeback might be on the cards.
