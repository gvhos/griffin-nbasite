                <h3 class="fact-title">LeBron James is the GOAT</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">This is the classic NBA debate, one that stirs up heated conversations on both sides. While Michael Jordan has more championships and arguably a higher peak than James, I ultimately give LeBron the edge because of his longevity. Averaging 24.4 PPG at age 40 is ridiculous; no one’s been as good for as long as LeBron. Ultimately, I think LBJ is the best player ever. </p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">The 2016-17 Warriors are the best team ever</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">The 2017 Golden State Warriors are the definition of a “superteam”, and for good reason. Led by Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, they decimated every team in their path on their way to a 67-win regular season and a 16-1 title run. The combination of talent, depth, and coaching on the 2016-17 Warriors is likely something we’ll never see again, making them the best team ever. </p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">Kobe Bryant isn’t a top 10 player all-time</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">This is definitely a controversial take, so let me explain. Bryant was an extraordinary player, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t think his accolades are as good as some other guys I have inside the top 10. Kobe benefited from playing next to great teammates for most of his career, along with arguably the best coach ever in Phil Jackson. Guys like Tim Duncan, Wilt Chamberlain, and Hakeem Olajuwon all did more than Kobe with less help at their peak, in my opinion. </p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">Bernard King is the most underrated player ever</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Somebody NBA fans should talk about more is Bernard King. The 6-7 small forward was a force to be reckoned with at his peak, putting up a league-leading 32.9 PPG during the 1984-85 campaign. Despite suffering multiple serious injuries, King played well into his 30s, earning an All-Star appearance in his 13th season. A 4-time All-Star and Hall of Famer, King’s combination of a great peak and solid longevity was a rarity for his era.</p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">Steph Curry is the most influential player ever</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Steph Curry single handedly changed the NBA, shifting the league’s focus towards three-point shooting. Today, nearly every NBA player can knock down triples, thanks in large part to Steph. The 6-2 guard revolutionized the three-point shot, making it cool for NBA players and fans alike. Without Steph, the modern offensive game would probably look very different.</p>

                <h3 class="fact-title"> Dave Cowens is the least deserving MVP</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Celtics center Dave Cowens won the 1972-73 MVP award, averaging 20.5 PPG and 16.2 RPG while appearing in all 82 games. Not a bad season by any means, but did he deserve to win MVP? I don’t think so. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar put up 30.2 PPG on much better efficiency that same year. Whether you want to give the award to Kareem or someone else, it’s clear that Cowens probably shouldn’t have finished first in the voting. </p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">The 1990s were not a very tough era to play in</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Many NBA fans think of the ‘90s as an extremely difficult era to win in; Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, John Stockton, Patrick Ewing, and other superstars were all in their primes. However, in reality, the 1990s weren’t as tough as some people think. Jordan and Olajuwon combined for 8 championships in the decade, while most other teams struggled to generate top-end talent. Offensive and defensive schemes weren’t as intricate as they are today, meaning most modern stars would thrive in the ‘90s.
