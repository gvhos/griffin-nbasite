            <div class="article-meta">
                Published: May 5, 2025 | Author: Griffin Bond

            <p>While the 2025 NBA draft class has some clear prospects with star upside near the top of the board, consensus differs wildly as you move farther down in the lottery. Cooper Flagg is the main guy every team wants, but are the prospects ranked after him a worthy consolation prize? Below, I'll give you my top 5 players in the 2025 Draft, along with their strengths, weaknesses, and a NBA comparison.   </p>
            
            <div class="prospect-card" style="background-color: #2381D9">
                <h3>1. Cooper Flagg (Duke)</h3>
                <img src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/04/896/500/cooper-flagg5.jpg?ve=1&tl=1" alt="Cooper Flagg" style="max-width: 330px; float: right; margin: 0 0 15px 15px;">
                <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Flagg is one of the best prospects we’ve seen in years. The 18-year-old led Duke to a 27-9 record and a Final Four appearance, scoring nearly 20 points a contest. Cooper leveraged his elite athleticism and lengthy frame to terrorize opposing defenses nightly. It’s Flagg’s defense, however, that’s arguably his best skill. At 6-9, 205 pounds, Flagg projects to be versatile enough to guard multiple positions at the next level. He totaled 1.4 SPG and 1.4 BPG, both impressive figures for a freshman. Ultimately, the team that gets the #1 overall pick will select Flagg with no hesitation on June 25th. </p>
				<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> There’s not much. To be nitpicky, Cooper would probably benefit from bulking up, as he’s somewhat thin at the moment. Flagg’s also not the most creative isolation scorer due to his loose handle. Outside of those minor issues, Flagg is as close to a foolproof prospect as you’ll see.

                    <strong>Key Stats:</strong> 19.2 PPG | 7.5 RPG | 4.2 APG | 59.3% TS
                </div>
                <p><strong>NBA Comparison:</strong> Jayson Tatum</p>
                <p><strong>Draft Night Age:</strong> 18.5 years old</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="prospect-card" style="background-color: #FA0C48">
                 <h3>2. Dylan Harper (Rutgers)</h3>
                <img src="https://images.sidearmdev.com/convert?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdxbhsrqyrr690.cloudfront.net%2Fsidearm.nextgen.sites%2Fscarletknights.com%2Fimages%2F2024%2F12%2F4%2FDR3_4337.JPG&type=webp" alt="Cooper Flagg" style="max-width: 330px; float: right; margin: 0 0 15px 15px;">
                <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Standing at 6-6, 215 pounds, Harper is massive for a point guard. He has incredible footwork and is a ridiculous finisher for his size. Euro steps, pump fakes, step throughs, Harper has it all in his bag once he gets inside the paint. He’s a master at manipulating the pick-and-roll; whether it’s attacking himself or playmaking for others, the Rutgers product rarely makes the wrong decision. Add in a solid jump shot, and there’s a lot to like. </p>
				<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Defensively, Harper leaves a lot to be desired. Quicker players could get around him at the college level, a problem that will only become more glaring in the NBA. A lot of the struggles defensively stem from Harper’s slower foot speed. Will that hamper him on the offensive end as well? Only time will tell.</p>
                <div class="prospect-stats">
                    <strong>Key Stats:</strong> 19.4 PPG | 4.6 RPG | 4.0 APG | 1.4 SPG
                </div>
                <p><strong>NBA Comparison:</strong> Cade Cunningham</p>
                <p><strong>Draft Night Age:</strong> 19.3 years old</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="prospect-card" style="background-color: #238B63">
                <h3>3. V. J. Edgecombe (Baylor)</h3>
                <img src="https://www.hoopshq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/GettyImages-2196891715.jpg?fit=1200%2C800" alt="Basketball prospect" style="max-width: 330px; float: left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;">
                <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> A freak athlete, Edgecombe creates chaos in a positive way on both sides of the ball. Offensively, with a quick first step and an incredible vertical jump, it’s nearly impossible to stay in front of V.J. The 19-year-old has a certain smoothness to his game that’s addicting to watch; he’ll make a couple of plays per game that make you nearly jump out of your seat. Totaling 2.1 SPG, his high motor on both ends is something every NBA coach will want. </p>
				 <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> How much does Edgecombe rely on his athleticism compared to his technique? Your answer to that question probably determines your opinion on the Baylor product. Regardless, it’s undeniable that Edgecombe’s athleticism is his main attribute, something that could be neutralized at the next level. I think he’ll adjust, but it may take some time for the raw teenager to become an impact pro.</p>
                <div class="prospect-stats">
                    <strong>Key Stats:</strong> 15.0 PPG | 5.6 RPG | 3.2 APG | 34.0% 3PT
                </div>
                <p><strong>NBA Comparison:</strong> Victor Oladipo</p>
                <p><strong>Draft Night Age:</strong> 19.9 years old</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="prospect-card" style="background-color: #FA0C48">
                <h3>4. Ace Bailey (Rutgers)</h3>
                <img src="https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/ttownmedia.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/eb/4ebb99e3-4796-5c4f-88f9-cc797fe3ffa5/680901beeec89.image.jpg" alt="Cooper Flagg" style="max-width: 300px; float: right; margin: 0 0 15px 15px;">
                <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> 
				It’s hard to find a more polarizing prospect than Bailey. Depending on who you talk to, he’s a future star or an overconfident role player. Standing at 6-10, Ace moves very well for his size and he’s molded like the prototypical big wing scorer every organization wants. Bailey takes and makes tough shots with a hand in his face consistently. Bailey competes defensively as well, leveraging his 7-0 wingspan to frustrate opposing scorers.</p>
				<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Bailey is a questionable decision maker, to say the least. If the ball is in his hands, there's a good chance it's going up. His 0.65 AST-TO ratio is quite concerning and the Rutgets product makes multiple head-scratching decisions a night. Bailey’s success at the next level will probably hinge on how much his feel for the game improves.</p>
                <div class="prospect-stats">
                    <strong>Key Stats:</strong> 17.6 PPG | 7.2 RPG | 1.3 BPG | 34.6% 3PT
                </div>
                <p><strong>NBA Comparison:</strong> Michael Porter Jr.</p>
                <p><strong>Draft Night Age:</strong> 18.9 years old</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="prospect-card" style="background-color: #D02425">
                <h3>5. Jeremiah Fears (Oklahoma)</h3>
                <img src="https://media.video-cdn.espn.com/motion/2025/0402/dm_250402_SEC_NCB_Interview_Jeremiah_Fears_Up_Next_250402/dm_250402_SEC_NCB_Interview_Jeremiah_Fears_Up_Next_250402.jpg" alt="Basketball prospect" style="max-width: 330px; float: left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;">
                <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Fears was born to be a scorer, with a bag as deep as the ocean. The 6-4 guard averaged 17.1 PPG last year and he can score the ball at all three levels. Jeremiah’s a fearless playmaker as well, zipping passes across the court with pinpoint accuracy. Guards with Fears’ combination of scoring and passing don’t grow on trees, and it’s easy to see how the Oklahoma product might tantalize a front office in the early lottery.</p>
				 <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Can Fears defend at the NBA level? Weighing a mere 182 pounds, he’ll need to bulk up to become more impactful on that side of the ball. The shot is questionable as well, as Fears only knocked down 28.4% of his threes in college. </p>
