                <p>We’re now at least halfway through each second round series of the NBA Playoffs, with a lot of surprising results in both conferences. In the East, the Indiana Pacers lead the 1-seed Cleveland Cavaliers 3-1, while the New York Knicks are ahead of the Boston Celtics by the same margin. Out west, the Minnesota Timberwolves lead the Golden State Warriors and the Denver Nuggets are tied with the OKC Thunder heading into game 5. What have the different series taught us? Here’s one takeaway from each set of games:

                <h3>Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Indiana Pacers</h3>
				<h3 style="color: red">The Cavs Need To Make Some Big Moves This Offseason</h3>
                
                <p>Coming into this series, almost no one expected the Pacers to win, let alone be up 3-1 through 4 games. Indiana—led by stars Tyrese Haliburton and Pascal Siakam—is a solid team, but they won 14 less games than Cleveland during the regular season. The Cavs, however, have fallen apart in this series, partly because of injuries and partly due to lackluster performances from their stars (outside of Donovan Mitchell). All-Star guard Darius Garland has missed multiple games in this series, and when he plays, he’s been below-average. The same goes for Evan Mobley. At the end of the day, between these injuries and poor showings, something has to change with the Cavs core. After losing to the Celtics in the second round last year, Cleveland is at risk of another lackluster finish if they don’t pull it together.</p>

                <h3>Boston Celtics vs. Indiana Pacers</h3>
				<h3 style="color: red">Jalen Brunson Is An Elite First Option</h3>
                
              <p>Coming into this series, everyone knew Jalen Brunson was very good, but these past 4 games have elevated him into true superstar status. Brunson has scored at least 25 points in 3 out of the 4 games, along with over 5 assists in every contest. Jalen is proving why he’s the true engine of the Knick’s offense, as he’s hit some absolutely ridiculous shots down the stretch. With a 3-1 lead and Jayson Tatum seriously injured, New York is in the driver's seat of the series, thanks to Brunson. Ultimately, the Villanova product is one of the best players in the entire NBA.

                <h3>Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Denver Nuggets</h3>
				<h3 style="color: red">The Thunder Aren’t As Foolproof As We Thought</h3>
                
              <p>The general NBA public expected the Oklahoma City Thunder to steamroll their way to the NBA Finals, however OKC’s run hasn’t been super smooth. The Denver Nuggets have given the Thunder some major problems, even with Nuggets star Nikola Jokić’s shooting struggles. Excluding game 2, OKC has had some major problems scoring the basketball, with potential MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander looking more mortal than normal. The Thunder have experienced some serious growing pains, especially in game 3 where they choked a 3 point lead in the final 20 seconds before losing in overtime. Is OKC’s core too young to get the job done?

                <h3>Minnesota Timberwolves vs. Golden State Warriors</h3>
				<h3 style="color: red">The Warriors Badly Need Steph Curry Back</h3>
                
              <p>This series was always going to be an uphill battle for the Warriors after Steph Curry’s injury in game 1, but the subsequent contests have shown that Golden State needs him back even more than we originally thought. Jimmy Butler has had a disappointing series so far, while the dynamic duo of Julius Randle and Anthony Edwards has propelled Minnesota to a commanding 3-1 lead. Most recently, Edwards and Randle combined for an efficient 61 points, while Butler only put up 14. The Warriors offense has been quite stagnant and unproductive without Steph, something they need to change fast if they want to put some pressure on the T-Wolves. If Curry doesn’t come back for game 5, I think the Warriors are done.

                <p>Down 2-0, both the Cavaliers and Celtics aren’t in great spots, however, I don’t think either of them are in a hopeless situation at the moment. If Boston can knock down the three-ball at a higher rate and Cleveland can tighten up their defense, a comeback might be on the cards.
