            <p>The first round of the 2025 NBA playoffs was extremely exciting, with a bunch of entertaining series and unpredictable results. Who's to say the second round can't be even better? Here are my predictions for each second round series, with an explanation for each one: </p>
            
            <div class="series-prediction" style="background-color: #FDBB30">
                <div class="matchup">(1) Cleveland Cavaliers vs (4) Indiana Pacers</div>
                <div class="prediction-details">
                    <span class="prediction-outcome">Cavaliers in 6</span>
                </div>
                <div class="analysis">
                    <p>At the time of this writing, the Pacers have already taken a 1-0 lead in this series. However, I trust the Cavs to bounce back in game 2 and ultimately win the series. If Darius Garland—who missed game 1 with a toe injury—is back on Tuesday, Cleveland will be in a good spot, despite being down in the series. The trio of Donovan Mitchell, Garland, and Evan Mobley is a force to be reckoned with, as the three combined to score 63 PPG during the regular season. Don’t sleep on the Cavs depth either; Ty Jerome, Max Strus, and De’Andre Hunter are all solid complementary pieces that can swing a big game. I think the Pacers—led by an All-NBA level guard in Tyrese Haliburton—are an underrated squad, but I predict the Cavaliers' combination of star power and depth will be enough to overcome them. Kenny Atkinson’s squad won 64 games in the regular season, after all.</p>

                <div class="matchup">(2) Boston Celtics vs (3) New York Knicks</div>
                <div class="prediction-details">
                    <span class="prediction-outcome">Celtics in 7</span>
                           </div>
                <div class="analysis">
                    <p>The defending champ Boston Celtics face their biggest test yet in a scrappy New York Knicks team round 2. Led by the dynamic duo of Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns, the Knicks defeated the Detroit Pistons in 6 games round 1 in an extremely entertaining series. Brunson dropped 40 points in the closeout contest, and the Villanova product will look to continue his dominance versus one of the best defenses in the association. The Celtics, however, are as well equipped as any team to stop Brunson. Jrue Holiday and Derrick White should be able to limit New York’s star guard, while Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown can push Boston over the top offensively. It’ll be a close series, but I’ve got the Celtics winning in 7.</p>

                <div class="matchup" style="color: black">(1) Oklahoma City Thunder vs (4) Denver Nuggets</div>
                <div class="prediction-details">
                    <span class="prediction-outcome">Thunder in 5</span>
                        </div>
                <div class="analysis">
                    <p>The Denver Nuggets should be oozing with confidence after beating the LA Clippers by 19 points in game 7 on Saturday. Nikola Jokić is arguably the best player in the world and Jamal Murray seems to level up each May. You know who may be even better than Jokić, though? Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Oklahoma City’s superstar averaged 32.7 PPG in the regular season, and he looks primed to stop Jokic from winning a 4th MVP award. Stars win series, and I believe OKC has the best player in this matchup. Shai’s supporting cast is also much better than Jokić’s, as Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren will be there to pick up the slack if SGA has an off night. All signs point to the Thunder—victors of 68 games in the regular season—winning this series convincingly. </p>

                <div class="matchup">(6) Minnesota Timberwolves vs (7) Golden State Warriors</div>
                <div class="prediction-details">
                    <span class="prediction-outcome">Timberwolves in 7</span>
                </div>
                <div class="analysis">
                    <p>I keep switching my pick for this series. On one hand, the Warriors are much more experienced than Minnesota; Steph Curry and Jimmy Butler are two of the best playoff performers of our generation. The duo combined for 42 points in game 7 versus the Rockets, with veteran sharpshooter Buddy Hield exploding for 33 as well. On the other hand, the Timberwolves have Anthony Edwards and just stunned the basketball community by taking down LeBron James and Luka Doncic in just 5 games. In the end, I trust Ant and the Wolves underrated depth to get the job done against the Warriors. Minnesota would have home-court advantage in a potential game 7, which I think is enough for me to give them an edge in the series.
