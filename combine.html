            <div class="article-intro" style="font-size: 1.1em">
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">The NBA Draft Combine took place last week in Chicago, where nearly a hundred prospects competed in scrimmages, athletic testing, and more. A bunch of NBA evaluators were there, analyzing the players and determining whether they have a future in the league. Although you shouldn’t rely very much on information gathered from the combine, it is a solid indicator of which prospects' stock is going up and which is going down. Here are some of my draft risers and fallers after last week:

            <!-- First section -->
            <div class="article-section">
                <h3>Risers</h3>
				<h3 style="color: red">Hansen Yang (Qingdao Eagles)</h3>
                
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Hansen Yang was a major question mark heading into the combine, but he definitely earned himself some new fans with his performance. The Chinese center showcased his reliable touch around the rim, scoring with ease in the scrimmage over some of the top rim protectors in the class. Defensively, Yang struggled to guard on the perimeter, but he did a nice job altering shots at the rim. Standing at 7-1 with a 9-3 standing reach, Yang has the length to be a longtime center in the NBA. Add in his solid playmaking feel, and it’s easy to see an NBA team taking a flier on Hansen in the second round after his combine showing.</p>

            <!-- Second section -->
            <div class="article-section">
              
				<h3 style="color: red">Egor Demin (BYU)</h3>
                
              <p style="font-size: 1.1em">BYU freshman Egor Demin is a very polarizing prospect, but he helped silence some critics during the combine. Demin measured well, standing at 6-8 ¼ without shoes (meaning his on-court height is close to 6-10). Demin’s outside shot is a major swing factor regarding his NBA outlook—the 19-year-old shot a mere 27.3% from three in college—but Egor looked confident shooting-wise during the combine. His pro day was positive, and Demin also nailed a reported 16 threes in just 35 seconds. At this point, I’d be quite surprised if he isn’t selected in the top 20 come June 25th.

				<h3 style="color: red">Maxime Raynaud (Stanford) </h3>
                
              <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Stanford center Maxime Raynaud had an incredible senior season last year, putting up 20.2 PPG and leading the ACC with 10.6 RPG. However, despite his strong production, a lot of scouts still question Raynaud’s ability to defend and move laterally at the professional level. Maxime did a lot to help his cause during the combine, as he graded first among centers in lane agility (11.31 seconds) and second in three-quarter sprint (3.23 seconds). Additionally, Raynaud played comfortably in the scrimmage, scoring the ball at will versus less developed prospects. The 7-1 big is now someone NBA teams will certainly consider in the late first.

                <h3><u>Fallers</u></h3>
				<h3 style="color: red">Derik Queen (Maryland)</h3>
                
              <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Derik Queen still projects to be a lottery pick, but the Maryland center didn’t help his stock during the combine. He finished with a horrid score of 12.45 seconds during the lane agility drill, the third lowest score in the previous 5 years of the combine. Queen also finished second-to-last in every other athleticism drill, which may be a major concern for many scouts. Add in the fact that he didn’t shoot the ball at a high level last week—Queen’s jumper had a noticeable hitch—and it’ll be interesting to see if the 20-year-old’s stock takes a major hit. A silver lining is that Queen’s measurables weren’t bad, but I’m still questioning his NBA outlook now.

				<div class="article-section">
                
				<h3 style="color: red">Jase Richardson (Michigan State) </h3>
                
              <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Unlike Derik Queen, Richardson’s measurables are what hurt his stock a lot last Wednesday. The Michigan State product had one of the most disappointing heights out of anyone, measuring at 6-0.5 and 178.4 pounds, a far cry from his listed height of 6-3. Richardson has a good NBA skillset with a solid outside shot, but I’m not sure how he’ll fit in the modern NBA if he’s that short. The 19-year-old will need to prove he’s athletic and crafty enough to hang with the best athletes in the world, since he’s even smaller than we thought. Richardson’s 6-6 wingspan will help him on defense, but I’m less bullish about his offensive outlook after the combine.

                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">All things considered, it’s important to take the NBA Draft Combine with a grain of salt. Plenty of prospects have had disappointing performances in Chicago but still become great players, and vice versa. However, the guys I mentioned today have seen their stocks shift dramatically after their combine showings.
