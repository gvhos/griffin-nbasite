            <p style="font-size: 1.1em">After getting the #3 overall pick in the draft lottery last Monday, the Philadelphia 76ers are now in a very interesting position. They could stick with the pick and potentially select Ace Bailey, V.J. Edgecombe or another high-upside prospect of their choosing. At the same time, numerous reports have come out recently showing that Sixers may look to trade down with the third pick. According to DraftExpress, “The Sixers could target Kevin Durant or Lauri Markkanen with a package that includes Paul George and the No. 3 pick.” What would a trade down for one of these guys or another star look like? Here are a few mock deals I came up with that I think are fair for both sides:

            <div class="series-prediction" style="background-color: #777D84">
				<div class="matchup" style="color: black"><u>Trade #1</u></div>
					<h3>Sixers receive: Cam Johnson, #8 pick</h3>
				<h3>Nets receive: Kelly Oubre, Andre Drummond, #3 pick</h3>
							<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3424,h_1926,x_0,y_18/c_fill,w_720,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_76ers/01jgs072gtphr4kzdmbh.jpg" alt="Cam Johnson" style="max-width: 410px; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;">
                <div class="analysis">
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The Brooklyn Nets had a disastrous result in the draft lottery, falling to the 8th overall pick despite finishing with a poor 26-56 record. The Nets have no stars on their current roster, and they also lack exciting young talent. One way they can guarantee themselves a great prospect? Trading up. In this trade, Brooklyn could snatch Ace Bailey or V.J. Edgecombe at 3, while the Sixers could acquire a high-level role player in Cam Johnson and still have a lottery pick. Johnson had a great 2024-25 campaign, averaging 18.8 PPG on 39% shooting from three. At 8, Philadelphia could target Kon Knueppel or Derik Queen, both players that would fit well next to Joel Embiid. If President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey still believes in the 76ers core, this might be the best realistic offer he’ll get.

				<div class="matchup" style="color: black"><u>Trade #2</u></div>
					<h3>Sixers receive: Lauri Markkanen, #5 pick</h3>
				<h3>Jazz receive: Paul George, #3 pick, #35 pick</h3>
							<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3020,h_1698,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_720,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_76ers/01jnwh9k7e7dhvf1py3s.jpg" alt="Lauri" style="max-width: 410px; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;">
                <div class="analysis">
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  Lauri Markkanen is coming off of an underwhelming season, but the Finnish forward still has solid value. Standing at 7 feet tall, Lauri is one of the best outside shooters in the entire NBA for his size (38.0% 3PT% with the Jazz). Markkanen would fit nicely next to Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey, since he can space the floor and attack off the catch when needed. The 27-year-old also makes more sense for Philadelphia long-term than Paul George, since he’s 8 years younger. Why would Utah do this deal, though? I think it boils down to the fact that they get to move up to the #3 spot and potentially select a future star in Ace Bailey. Jazz President Danny Ainge has had success drafting lengthy forwards in the past, and Bailey has all the tools necessary to be a future All-Star. The Jazz lack a true blue-chip prospect at the moment, but that would change if they got the third overall pick. Paul George would also be the perfect mentor for Bailey, or Utah could flip PG for more picks.

				<div class="matchup" style="color: black"><u>Trade #3</u></div>
					<h3>Sixers receive: Deni Avdija, #11 pick</h3>
				<h3>Trail Blazers receive: Kelly Oubre, Andre Drummond, #3 pick, #35 pick, 2028 first round pick swap</h3>
							<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4754,h_2674,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_720,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/229/01jp3f8qeskg1phpy41c.jpg" alt="Deni" style="max-width: 410px; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;">
                <div class="analysis">
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  To people that don’t watch the NBA much, this may seem like an overpay for Deni Avdija. However, Deni had a career year last season, averaging an efficient 16.9 PPG while playing excellent defense on a nightly basis. He’d be the perfect third or fourth option on the Sixers; Avdija’s rim pressure and intense defense would complement Philadelphia’s stars nicely. Additionally, the 24-year-old has done a nice job developing his outside shot. Avdija connected on 36.5% of his triples last season, the second highest mark of his career. But for all the reasons I mentioned above, would Portland be hesitant to part ways with Deni? Potentially, although this return would guarantee them a young, high-upside piece and some more future assets. If Trail Blazers General Manager Joe Cronin doesn’t believe in the current core, trading Avdija while his value is at its peak might be smart. Ace Bailey is 6 years younger than Deni, and he may be a better fit next to Scoot Henderson and Anfernee Simons. At the very least, Portland’s long-term ceiling would be higher if they made this trade.

                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Ultimately, the most likely course of action for the Sixers is that they keep the third pick and draft an exciting young talent. However, if Daryl Morey wants to trade down, all three trades I proposed today project to make Philadelphia better next year.
