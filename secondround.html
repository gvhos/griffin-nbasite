            <p>The second round of the NBA draft often gets overlooked, as most fans and experts mostly analyze the top of the class. However, history has shown us time and time again that teams that prioritize late-round drafting will have a leg up on their competition. From Nikola Jokić, to Draymond Green, to Jalen Brunson, many star players have been selected past pick 30. Who from this year’s draft could join those guys? I have some names:   </p>
            
            <div class="prospect-card" style="background-color: #E87722">
                <h3>Johni Broome (Auburn)</h3>
                <img src="https://auburntigers.com/imgproxy/I5RYgn7I0QmWGpSaRXRm1tI_OeZkBXsf7pA_kRFNxD8/rs:fit:1980:0:0/g:ce/q:90/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlLmdvb2dsZWFwaXMuY29tL2F1YnVybi1wcm9kLzIwMjQvMTIvMjEvR3ZLNGE3VElRTGxqNzZOcnB3NEtTNEJJWk9kNWxaeEpaOVV1OUJXOS5qcGc.jpg" alt="Broome" style="max-width: 330px; float: right; margin: 0 0 15px 15px;">
				<p>Broome has been an incredible college player for Auburn. The 6-10 big man scored 18.6 PPG this past season on his way to becoming named a consensus All-American. We’ve seen many college stars like Broome flame out in the NBA, but I think things could be different for him.</p>
                <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> <ul>- Elite shot blocker with incredible timing. Led the SEC with 2.1 BPG in 2024-25.</ul>
				<ul>- One of the most dominant rebounders for his size, finished with 9.3 RPG (3.0 ORB) across 3 seasons at Auburn.</ul>
				<ul>- A force to be reckoned with down low. Broome has elite footwork and touch around the rim, making him a ridiculous low-post scorer.</ul>
				<ul>- Sets crunching screens and rolls very hard. Broome is willing to do all the little things.
</ul>
				</p>
				<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> <ul>- Isn’t the most versatile defender. Struggles to switch onto smaller and quicker guards out on the perimeter. 
</ul>
			<ul>- Broome is a below average outside shooter at this stage of his career. He shot a mere 27.8% from deep this past year.

</ul>
</p>

            <div class="prospect-card" style="background-color: #0062C4">
                 <h3>Kam Jones (Marquette)</h3>
                <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3OupDKgrWsRhTOiNujQLb6Y1xTg=/0x214:2672x3307/1200x800/filters:focal(1059x707:1485x1133)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71575011/1394601967.0.jpg" alt="Jones" style="max-width: 330px; float: right; margin: 0 0 15px 15px;">
				<p>Like Broome, Marquette guard Kam Jones was an ultra productive upperclassman. Standing at 6-5, Jones has the requisite size for an NBA guard, along with a potent ability to score at all three levels.</p>
				
                <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> <ul>- Jones is a scorer that can fill it up from anywhere on the court. He averaged 19.2 PPG for Marquette this past season on solid efficiency.
 
</ul>
				<ul>- Jones’ has unlimited range from beyond the arc. He routinely makes threes from NBA range, a welcome sign when projecting how his shooting will translate to the next level.

</ul>
				<ul>- Improved a lot as a playmaker during the 24-25 campaign. Kam most recently dished out a career-high 5.9 APG. 

</ul></p>
				<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> <ul>- Has a lot of limitations on the defensive end. In his current state, Jones doesn’t have the foot speed or lateral quickness to hang with smaller, more shifty ball-handlers. 


</ul>
	<ul>- Jones isn’t a terrible athlete, however, his measurables won’t jump off the charts. The 23-year-old struggles to finish in traffic at times because of his poor vertical jump.


</ul>

                <h3>Miles Byrd (San Diego State)</h3>
                <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b64ded_2f8fd070b5094a0cb49835766c37c64f~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_500,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/b64ded_2f8fd070b5094a0cb49835766c37c64f~mv2.jpg" alt="Byrd" style="max-width: 330px; float: left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;">
				<p>San Diego State junior Miles Byrd is one of the most intriguing second round prospects in this year’s draft class, especially on the defensive side of the ball. The 20-year-old averaged 2.1 SPG and 1.1 BPG during the most recent campaign. </p>
                <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> <ul>- As I mentioned above, Byrd is a great defender. He’s tall and strong enough to disrupt bigger wings, while he also uses a lengthy frame to make an impact off-ball.

 
</ul>
				<ul>- The effort Byrd brings nightly is contagious. He’s the first one on the floor for most loose balls, and he has a relentless motor.

 
</ul>
				<ul>- High feel for the game. Miles keeps the ball moving at a high level, and he consistently makes the right decisions.

 
</ul></p>
				 <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> <ul>- The shot is questionable, to say the least. Byrd only connected on 30.4% of his triples throughout college.


 
</ul>
<ul>- Byrd doesn’t have much of an ability to gain separation from his defenders because he lacks an elite first step and a tight handle. This will only get harder for him at the NBA level.

</ul></p>

                <p>At the end of the day, the second round of the NBA Draft is always a crapshoot. However, selecting prospects that were productive in college and have translatable skills is a great way to approach the round. Johni Broome, Kam Jones, and Miles Byrd all fit that criteria.
