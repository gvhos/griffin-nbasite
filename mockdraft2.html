                <h3 class="fact-title">Brooklyn Nets: Kasparas Jakucionis (Illinois)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Coming off a disastrous season where they finished 26-56 and find themselves outside the top 5 in the draft, the Nets are desperate for any talent they can find. If the board shakes out how I think it will, Jakucionis should be the pick here, as he’s the best player available. The 6-6 point guard averaged 15.0 PPG and 4.7 APG during his freshman campaign, showcasing his high basketball IQ and well-rounded skillset on a nightly basis. Jakucionis isn’t a great defender yet, and he needs to work on his outside shot (31.8% 3P% last year), but those improvements should come in a time on a Brooklyn team where he’ll get plenty of opportunities. </p>

                <h3 class="fact-title"> Toronto Raptors: Khaman Maluach (Duke)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">The third Duke player selected in my mock draft, Maluach feels like a classic pick for Raptors president Masai Ujiri. The 7-2 big man was one of the best defenders in college basketball, swatting 1.3 shots a contest and also grabbing 6.6 rebounds per game. Maluach’s freshman season ended poorly with 0 rebounds versus Houston in the Final Four, however, the South Sudan native has all the tools he needs to be a productive NBA player in a few years. Toronto is looking for their center for the future, so taking Maluach makes all the sense in the world. </p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">Houston Rockets: Carter Bryant (Arizona)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Carter Bryant’s stats won’t jump off the page, however the 6-8 wing is oozing with potential. Bryant’s got a sturdy frame and a reliable outside shot (37.1% 3P%), meaning he should be able to contribute right away while also having room to grow. This makes him a perfect fit on a young Rockets team that’s already a playoff contender. Bryant would probably see the floor in year 1, while also developing alongside Alperen Şengün and Amen Thompson long-term.</p>

                <h3 class="fact-title"> Portland Trail Blazers: Egor Demin (BYU)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Standing at 6-9, Egor Demin has the measurables to be a long time NBA point guard. The BYU product put up 10.6 PPG and 5.5 APG for the cougars last season, helping them to an impressive 26-10 record. However, it is worth noting that Demin turned the ball over an average of 3.9 times per game, a concerning mark for someone that projects to be a PG at the next level. Pair that with his questionable three-ball, and there are definitely questions next to the Russian’s name. At the end of the day, though, I believe Portland is the right team to take a chance on Egor, as he’d be a great fit next to Anfernee Simons in the backcourt.</p>

                <h3 class="fact-title"> Chicago Bulls: Derik Queen (Maryland)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Queen will probably end up being a steal at this spot, especially if he goes to a Chicago team in need of their center for the future. Derik had an exceptional season for Maryland, with an excellent March Madness being the icing on the cake. The 6-10 big man has a unique skillset, as he has incredible touch for someone his size. If Queen can effectively defend centers in the NBA, we may look back on this pick as one of the best in the draft.</p>

                <h3 class="fact-title"> Atlanta Hawks: Collin Murray-Boyles (South Carolina)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Despite featuring arguably the NBA’s best perimeter defender in Dyson Daniels, the Hawks were an abysmal defensive team last season. How can Atlanta fix this problem? Drafting Collin Murray-Boyles would be a perfect start. The South Carolina product might be the best defender in this entire class, with both the versatility and strength to cause problems for any offensive player. Murray-Boyles’ jump shot remains a question mark, however Trae Young would certainly give Collin a lot of room to operate on the offensive end. This is one of my favorite fits in the entire class.</p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">San Antonio Spurs: Jase Richardson (Michigan State)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Jase Richardson fits the mold of the type of prospect the Spurs organization loves. The Michigan State product is an extremely high IQ player that should be ready to contribute for San Antonio on day 1. The son of former NBA player Jason Richardson, Jase averaged 12.1 PPG on 41.2% shooting from deep for the Spartans last year. While Richardson may not have as much upside as some other guys in this class, his reliable shooting and elite feel make him intriguing.
