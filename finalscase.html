            <p style="font-size: 1.1em">As we advance farther and farther into the NBA playoffs, each remaining team becomes more hopeful that this might be the year they win it all. At the time of my writing, 6 teams remain alive in the playoffs, each with a solid chance of taking home some hardware. Below, I present the case how each team could win the Finals: </p>
            
            <div class="series-prediction" style="background-color: #00AE48">
                <div class="matchup">Boston Celtics</div>
                
                <div class="analysis">
                    <p>The Celtics probably have the hardest road to the championship, especially after Jayson Tatum’s achilles injury. Tatum will miss the rest of the playoffs, meaning Boston will have to rely on Jaylen Brown as their #1 option. However, Joe Mazzulla’s squad are the defending champs for a reason. Derrick White, Al Horford, Jrue Holiday, and Payton Pritchard are all incredible depth pieces, with the potential to swing any game in the Celtics’ favor. If they can come back from this 3-2 deficit to the Knicks, the sky’s the limit for Boston. </p>

           <div class="series-prediction" style="background-color: #F58426">
                <div class="matchup">New York Knicks</div>
                
                <div class="analysis">
                    <p>Up 3-2 against the Celtics, if the Knicks can close out this series, they’ll be in prime position to win it all. Led by Jalen Brunson—the 2025 NBA Clutch Player of the Year—New York has played some incredible basketball over the past month. They’re a very good defensive team, with OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, and Josh Hart all holding their own on a nightly basis. Stars win games, and Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns have the requisite star power to lead New York to the Finals. </p>

           <div class="series-prediction" style="background-color: #FDBB30">
                <div class="matchup">Indiana Pacers </div>
                
                <div class="analysis">
                    <p>The Indiana Pacers surprised the basketball community by beating the Cleveland Cavaliers in 5 games, proving that they’re a true contender. Tyrese Haliburton is one of the best offensive engines in the entire NBA, as he’s averaging 17.5 PPG and 9.3 APG during these playoffs. The Pacers play a fast-paced and unselfish brand of basketball, one that’s reminiscent of some successful teams of the past. If Indiana continues their red-hot three-point shooting, there is a legit chance they take home the Larry O’Brien trophy.</p>

			<div class="series-prediction" style="background-color: #3B6EBD">
                <div class="matchup">Denver Nuggets </div>
                
                <div class="analysis">
                    <p>The case for the Nuggets is simple. They have the championship pedigree, alongside Nikola Jokic, arguably the best player in the entire world. Many people expected the OKC Thunder to steamroll Denver in the second round, but the Nuggets have fought back, forcing a game 7 on Sunday. As long as both Jamal Murray and Jokic are healthy, Denver has the top-end talent to compete with anyone, even if they lack some of the depth. </p>

                <div class="matchup">Oklahoma City Thunder </div>
                
                <div class="analysis">
                    <p>The Thunder have had a playoff showing worth questioning, as they’ve underperformed in multiple games versus a less talented Nuggets team. However, this is still the same Thunder squad that won 68 games in the regular season with a ridiculous +12.8 rating. All Oklahoma City needs is potential MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to have a big shooting night, and they can beat any team in the association. Plus, the Thunder probably have the best depth in the NBA, often playing as much as 12 guys a night. </p>

                <div class="matchup">Minnesota Timberwolves</div>
                
                <div class="analysis">
                    <p>Anthony Edwards and the Timberwolves shocked the world by beating the Lakers in round 1 and the Warriors in round 2, and they have the chance to do so again in the Western Conference Finals. Julius Randle has been playing the best basketball of his life, putting up 23.9 PPG, 5.9 RPG, and 5.9 APG so far in the postseason. The trio of him, Edwards, and Rudy Gobert are enough to overwhelm opposing squads most nights. Add in Donte DiVincenzo, Naz Reid, and Jaden McDaniels, and it’s easy to be bullish on the Wolves title hopes.

                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Ultimately, some of the teams I mentioned above will have a much better chance of winning it all than others. This exercise showed me, though, that the NBA Finals are as wide open as they’ll ever be this year.
