            <div class="article-intro" style="font-size: 1.1em">
                <p>On Monday, the 76ers jumped up to the 3rd overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft. This means not only will Philadelphia keep their selection, but they’ll also get the chance to select a franchise-altering prospect at their spot. But who should Philadelphia target? Cooper Flagg and Dylan Harper project to go in the top 2, leaving some uncertainty as to the best course of action for President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey. Here are three players to consider:

            <!-- First section -->
            <div class="article-section">
                <h3>Ace Bailey</h3>
                
                <p>Rutgers forward Ace Bailey is undoubtedly one of the most polarizing prospects in the entire 2025 NBA Draft. On one hand, Bailey is an incredible shot-maker for his size, with the potential to also be a three-level scorer and defense disruptor. I don’t think it’s hyperbole to say that he has one of the best three-minute highlight reels you’ll see from a prospect. On the other hand, Bailey wasn’t very efficient in college and he struggles to create separation in the half court with a lackluster handle. His HC Rim Frequency being 15.3% is abysmal, the lowest mark out of any top prospect.

    <h3>Ace Bailey Highlights</h3>

    </div>
</div>
                
                <p>While it’s important to recognize Ace’s flaws, it’s also worth mentioning that he was on a horrible Rutgers team last year. He had very few teammates that could actually shoot the ball, meaning there wasn’t much room for Bailey to operate. If he went to a better school in the SEC or Big 12, it’s possible we’d be talking about the 6-10 forward in a completely different light. Ultimately, I think the poor advanced analytics keep Morey away from drafting Bailey, but it’s understandable if his upside tantalizes the Sixers front office. </p>

            <!-- Second section -->
            <div class="article-section">
                <h3>V.J. Edgecombe</h3>
                
                <p>At the moment, V.J. Edgecombe would probably be my prospect of choice at the #3 pick. Edgecombe is a ridiculous athlete, boasting a 38.5 inch vertical jump at the combine, a better mark than a lot of other top prospects. The Baylor product averaged 15.0 PPG on 43.6% shooting for Scott Drew’s squad last year, leading them to a 20-15 record. He’s also done it on the international stage, as Edgecombe put up 20.5 PPG over a two game span for the Bahamas national team (more PPG than Eric Gordon, Buddy Hield, and DeAndre Ayton).</p>

    <h3>V.J. Edgecombe Highlights</h3>

    </div>
</div>
                
                <p>I’m not exactly sure what V.J.’s role would look like on the Sixers, but I’m confident the 6-5 wing could come in and contribute right away. Standing at 6-5, 180 pounds, Edgecombe’s frame isn’t the biggest, although he uses his lengthy frame and above-average athleticism to make up for his lack of height. The 19-year-old earned 2024-25 All-Big 12 honors for a reason, and there’s reason to believe he could be a building block for the 76ers franchise for years to come.</p>
            </div>
			
			<div class="article-section">
                <h3>Kon Knueppel</h3>
                
                <p>Kon Knueppel is projected to go in the mid-lottery, meaning the Sixers could probably trade down to get him. Often overshadowed by his Duke teammate Cooper Flagg, Knueppel has one of the highest floors in the entire draft, despite not being talked about that much. The 6-7 wing knocked down 40.6% of his threes and converted an impressive 62.10% of his shots at the rim. Knueppel’s shown the ability to scale up and down his offensive role depending on who he’s playing alongside, a valuable skill for a Philadelphia squad with Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, and Paul George.</p>

    <h3>Kon Knueppel Highlights</h3>
    <div class="video-wrapper">

        <iframe width="560" height="315"

                allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
</div>
                
                <p>The main knock on Knueppel relates to his questionable defense. He doesn’t have a super lengthy frame, and Kon’s lateral quickness and jumping ability often cause eyebrows to raise in skepticism. However, despite his below-average physical tools, Knueppel has a high IQ and gives a lot of effort on the defensive side of the ball. There’ll be a steep learning curve for him at the NBA level, but there’s reason to believe the 19-year-old can become a fine defender in time. If Philadelphia believes in Kon’s offense, they shouldn’t have much trouble hiding him on the defensive end next to Joel Embiid and Paul George.</p>

            <div class="article-section conclusion" style="font-size: 1.1em">
                
                <p>Ultimately, the Sixers have a lot of options to consider with the third overall pick, and there'll be a lot of names thrown around in discussions over the next month. When it’s all said and done, though, I expect the team to select either Ace Bailey, V.J. Edgecombe, or Kon Knueppel.</p>
