            <p style="font-size: 1.14em">Tonight is the NBA Draft Lottery, a very important day for all Sixers fans. If Philadelphia’s pick lands in the top 6 (64% chance), they’ll be in a prime position to upgrade their team. However, if the 76ers pick falls outside the top 6, they’ll lose it to the Oklahoma City Thunder. With that in mind, which prospects should Philadelphia be eyeing at each slot? Here are my thoughts: </p>
            
            <div class="prospect-card" style="background-color: #2381D9">
                <h3>#1 Pick: Cooper Flagg (Duke)</h3>
                <img src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/04/896/500/cooper-flagg5.jpg?ve=1&tl=1" alt="Cooper Flagg" style="max-width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0 0 15px 15px;">
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>Explanation:</strong> If the Sixers are lucky enough to land the #1 pick, their selection will be an easy decision. Cooper Flagg is a generational prospect, with the two-way ability to transform the outlook of whatever franchise drafts him. The Duke freshman put up 19.2 PPG, 7.5 RPG, and 4.2 APG on 38.5% shooting from deep last year. Flagg would ultimately be the perfect fit next to Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey.

            <div class="prospect-card" style="background-color: #FA0C48">
                 <h3>#2 Pick: Dylan Harper (Rutgers)</h3>
                <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TO95mbNm7kPgoF2r2nbItLU1GI8=/0x0:3500x2331/1200x800/filters:focal(1305x863:1865x1423)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/74006385/2205213065.0.jpg" alt="Dylan Harper" style="max-width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0 0 15px 15px;">
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Dylan Harper’s fit with the 76ers would be a little wonky, however, the Rutgers guard is clearly the second best player in the 2025 draft. Harper is a tall point guard that draws comparisons to Cade Cunnigham thanks to his craftiness and scoring ability. He scored 19.4 PPG during the 2024-25 campaign and added over 4 assists per contest. Despite Philadelphia already having a lot of guards, Daryl Morey should target the best player available at 2 and take Harper. </p>

            <div class="prospect-card" style="background-color: #238B63">
                <h3>#3 Pick: V. J. Edgecombe (Baylor)</h3>
                <img src="https://www.hoopshq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/GettyImages-2196891715.jpg?fit=1200%2C800" alt="Basketball prospect" style="max-width: 220px; float: left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;">
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>Explanation:</strong> This spot is where the real discussions start. Multiple players would have a compelling case to be the Sixers pick at 3, but I ultimately give the edge to VJ Edgecombe. The Baylor product is arguably the most athletic prospect in this year’s draft and he’s both an elite defender and downhill scorer. We’ve seen athletic wings have success next to Joel Embiid, and I believe Edgecombe would fare the same. </p>

            <div class="prospect-card" style="background-color: #FA0C48">
                <h3>#4 Pick: Ace Bailey (Rutgers)</h3>
                <img src="https://images.sidearmdev.com/convert?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdxbhsrqyrr690.cloudfront.net%2Fsidearm.nextgen.sites%2Fscarletknights.com%2Fimages%2F2024%2F12%2F4%2F_1DB4549.JPG&type=webp" alt="Cooper Flagg" style="max-width: 220px; float: right; margin: 0 0 15px 15px;">
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>Explanation:</strong> 
				Ace Bailey is one of the most polarizing prospects in the 2025 draft, but one thing’s for sure: the 6-10 forward is a ridiculous shot-maker. Bailey averaged 17.6 PPG for Rutgers last season on a tough shot diet, knocking down nearly 35% of his threes. There’s a lot of risk involved with selecting Bailey, but if he hits, Ace has All-Star potential.</p>

            <div class="prospect-card" style="background-color:  #2381D9">
                <h3>#5 Pick: Kon Knueppel (Duke)</h3>
                <img src="https://www.fayobserver.com/gcdn/authoring/images/smg/2024/10/28/SMGW/75899688007-116-59627.jpeg?crop=5483,3085,x0,y285&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp" alt="Basketball prospect" style="max-width: 270px; float: left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;">
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Cooper Flagg’s Duke teammate Kon Knueppel quickly made a name for himself last college season. The 6-7 wing was one of the best shooters in all of college basketball, scoring 14.4 PPG on 47.9/40.6/91.4% shooting splits. Knueppel would be an incredible fit next to the Sixers big three, as we’ve seen lengthy shooters have success alongside Joel Embiid in the past. If Philadelphia’s pick falls outside the top 4, they should take Kon Knueppel.

                <h3>#6 Pick: Collin Murray-Boyles (South Carolina)</h3>
                <img src="https://www.si.com/.image/c_fill,w_1200,ar_4:3,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/MjA0NDgzMTk2MTk5MzgwNzY4/usatsi_22547989.jpg" alt="Basketball prospect" style="max-width: 190px; float: left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;">
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Murray-Boyles is one of the most underrated prospects in the entire 2025 NBA draft, in my opinion. The South Carolina product is a great defender, as he averaged 1.5 SPG and 1.3 BPG during his sophomore season. Collin is also a strong low post scorer that would fit the Guerschon Yabusele role for Nick Nurse’s squad. Despite being the oldest player I’ve mentioned today, there’s a lot to like about CMB.

			<div class="article-section conclusion">
                
                <p style="font-size: 1.14em">At the end of the day, as long as the Sixers keep their pick, Philadelphia fans should be quite happy. Furthermore, if the 76ers select one of the prospects I mentioned above, they'll be in a prime position to compete for a title in the near future. The 2025 NBA Draft is a pivotal one for Philadelphia; it's important that Daryl Morey and company have the right approach.</p>
