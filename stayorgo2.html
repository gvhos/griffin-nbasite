            <div class="article-intro" style="font-size: 1.1em">
                <p>After officially landing the number 3 overall pick in the draft on Monday, the 76ers offseason becomes a bit more clear. President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey, though, still has a lot of decisions to make regarding free agency. Which players that were on the Sixers last year should the team re-sign and which should they let go? Here are some of my takes:

</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- First section -->
            <div class="article-section">
                <h3>Kelly Oubre</h3>
				<h3 style="color: red">Verdict: Let him leave</h3>
                
                <p>Forward Kelly Oubre Jr. has a player option this offseason which he may pick up, but if he declines it, the Sixers shouldn’t bring him back. There are a lot of reasons to like Oubre; he plays hard, doesn’t miss very many games, and is a fan favorite. However, despite what he’s brought to Philadelphia these past 2 years, I don’t love Oubre’s fit long-term. The 6-8 wing is a questionable shooter, as he’s made a mere 30.3% of his threes with the Sixers. </p>
                
                
                <p>Philadelphia should look to improve their shooting and get younger this offseason, so getting rid of Oubre would be a step in the right direction, in my opinion. Kelly is a tenacious defender that has provided the Sixers with a lot of value these past 2 seasons, but I don’t fully trust him come playoff time. Ultimately, I think there are better options at the forward spot for Nick Nurse’s squad, especially if they draft V.J. Edgecombe or Ace Bailey with the 3rd pick.  </p>

            </div>
            
            <!-- Second section -->
            <div class="article-section">
                <h3>Jared Butler</h3>
				<h3 style="color: red">Verdict: Re-sign </h3>
                
                <p>I thought Jared Butler had an underrated second half to the year after the Sixers acquired him at the trade deadline from the Washington Wizards. Butler provided an under-manned Philadelphia team with solid shooting and playmaking, putting up 11.5 PPG and 4.9 APG across 28 games. Standing at only 6-3, 195 pounds, Butler has a lot of weaknesses related to his size, but he’s still comfortably an NBA player. The 76ers have a team option to re-sign Butler, which I think they should exercise. </p>
				
				
               <img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/U5Ftm2cGekAHzLMfF0clfw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTY0MDtoPTQyNztjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/sixers_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_847/4b4cb7d9eb4cb96daf313a4aad8c0b49" alt="Butler" class="article-image" style="max-height: 330px">
				
                <p>Neither Jared’s stats nor highlights will be extremely impressive, but he’s a competent bench guard on a cost-controlled contract. Butler will only earn 2.3 million next season if Philadelphia picks up his option, which is a figure less than the veteran minimum. He’s definitely better than Jeff Dowtin, a guy Nick Nurse has played as Philadelphia’s 4th or 5th guard the last couple of years. At only 24 years old, Jared still has room to grow alongside the 76ers young core.  </p>
            </div>
            
			 <div class="article-section">
                <h3>Andre Drummond</h3>
				<h3 style="color: red">Verdict: Let him leave </h3>
                
                <p>Like Kelly Oubre, Andre Drummond has a player option this offseason. While it’s ultimately his decision, the Sixers should do everything in their power to get Andre to decline the option. Drummond was a well-regarded 2024 offseason signing, however he disappointed big time during his second stint in the City of Brotherly Love. The 31-year-old posted the lowest PER (16.0) of his career by a wide margin and his counting stats were also below-average. Add in his lackluster rim protection, and it makes sense that most Philadelphia fans aren’t thrilled about the prospect of Andre returning. </p>
				
				
               <img src="https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/10/21/SSIX/75780068007-andre-drummond.jpg?crop=3071,1728,x0,y160&width=3071&height=1728&format=pjpg&auto=webp" alt="Drummond" class="article-image" style="max-height: 330px">
				
                <p>The emergence of young center Adem Bona only makes it more clear that Drummond’s time with the 76ers should be done. Bona—the Sixers second-round pick in 2024—was much better than Drummond last season, despite having much less experience than him. If Daryl Morey is sincere about wanting Philadelphia to get younger, it makes a ton of sense to swap Andre’s spot as the backup center with Adem. Not only is Bona an upgrade long-term, he’s also more capable in the present. </p>
            </div>
            
            
            <!-- Conclusion section -->
            <div class="article-section conclusion" style="font-size: 1.1em">
                
                <p>All things considered, the Sixers will have a bunch of free agent moves to make this offseason, not just the three I mentioned here. But by re-signing Butler and letting Oubre and Drummond go, Philadelphia will be better in both the short and long run.
