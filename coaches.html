            <p style="font-size: 1.1em">The NBA is a league with a storied history, with many all-time greats from each era. Just like how there have been lots of transcendent players throughout history, the coaches patrolling the sideline are just as important. Who are the best coaches in NBA history? There are certainly a lot of worthy candidates, but here’s my top 5:  </p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">Erik Spoelstra</h3>
				<h3>2 championships, 57.9% winning percentage</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Putting Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra on this list already might be premature, but I think he deserves it based on his longevity in a modern era that’s characterized by coaches getting fired a lot. The Heat hired Spoelstra in 2008, after he was a team video assistant and assistant coach for over six years. Since then, all he’s done is win, regardless of the roster Miami’s put on the floor. Most notably, Erik coached the Heat to two championships during the Lebron era, winning it all in 2012 and 2013. Something that’s flown under the radar, though, is how Spoelstra’s helped Miami remain competitive post-Lebron. They’ve made the Finals twice this decade without elite rosters and been in the playoffs virtually every season.  </p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">Pat Riley</h3>
				<h3>5 championships, 63.6% winning percentage</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Now most known as the front office mastermind behind the Miami Heat’s success, Pat Riley was once one of the best NBA coaches ever. Riley got his first head coaching job for the “Showtime” Lakers featuring Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Riley pioneered a fast and entertaining style of basketball, helping Los Angeles win 4 championships as a head coach. Defensively, Riley’s Lakers were characterized by using 1-3-1 defensive trap to force turnovers and run in transition. After stepping down from his Lakers job, Riley went to coach the Heat, where he led a gritty 2006 squad led by Dwyane Wade to a championship.  </p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">Gregg Popovich</h3>
				<h3>5 championships, 66.7% winning percentage</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Undoubtedly the greatest coach of the modern era, Gregg Popovich turned the San Antonio Spurs into a perennial powerhouse, coaching them to five championships during multiple different eras. He first won a ring in 1999, with legendary superstars David Robinson and Tim Duncan leading the way. Popvich’s last championship came in 2014, where he coached one of the most creative Spurs squads ever to a 4-1 domination over the Heat. The Spurs have never replicated that same postseason, but Popovich has remained an innovative and well-respected coach.</p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">Red Auerbach</h3>
				<h3>9 championships, 66.2% winning percentage</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">The Boston Celtics have had many incredible players throughout their history, but longtime head coach Red Auerbach is the biggest reason the franchise has the most championships of all-time. Auerbach built the Celtics dynasty from the ground up in the 1950s, acquiring and coaching legends such as Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, and John Havlicek during his time with Boston. Red emphasized teamwork and unselfishly pushing the ball forward; his teams never seemed to have one dominant scorer, often having a variety of guys score 15-20 points a night. Auerbach also helped decrease racial discrimination in the NBA as a head coach. He drafted the first black player, Chuck Cooper, and put out the first starting five featuring only African-Americans. Without Auerbach’s influence on the game, the NBA would probably look very different today.</p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">Phil Jackson</h3>
				<h3>11 championships, 70.4% winning percentage</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Phil Jackson is an easy decision for the number one spot on this list, as he boasts arguably the most impressive coaching resume in all of sports. Jackson won 11 championships with the Bulls and Lakers, helping make both Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant all-time greats. Jackson pioneered the triangle offense with the Bulls in the ‘90s, one of the most successful offensive schemes of all-time. He coached Chicago to 6 championships, before moving onto Los Angeles, where he had similar winning ways with the Lakers. Nicknamed the “Zen Master,” Jackson was able to manage the egos of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal and lead the Lakers to 5 titles. With the most championships of any NBA coach, it’s no surprise that Jackson is at #1. </p>
