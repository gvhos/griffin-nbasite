                <p>The start of the second round of the NBA playoffs has been surprising, to say the least. We’ve seen multiple upsets and a couple of monster individual performances. What stood out to me? Here are three takeaways:</p>

                <h3>Don’t Underestimate The Indiana Pacers</h3>
                
                <p>Most NBA experts and fans alike expected the Cavaliers—a 64-win juggernaut in the regular season—to dispose of the 4-seed Indiana Pacers relatively easily in the second round. However, Indiana showed they were serious on Sunday, winning 121-112 over Cleveland. Andrew Nembhard led the way for Indiana with 23 points on 7-10 shooting, and Tyrese Haliburton finished right behind him with 22 points and 13 assists. In a battle of two high-powered offenses, the Pacers certainly set the tone on Sunday.</p>

                <p>Can the Cavs bounce back? I’d count on it. Game 2 on Tuesday in Cleveland now becomes a must win for Kenny Atkinson’s squad, but the good news is that they may have star guard Darius Garland back from injury (he’s currently questionable). If Garland is out, I’d expect Donovan Mitchell to stay aggressive like he was in game 1, where he took 30 shots. Additionally, in order for the Cavs to win this one convincingly, Max Strus and Isaac Okoro will have to play better than they did in game one, where they shot 3-13 FG combined.</p>

                <h3>Jalen Brunson Is Better Than You Think</h3>
                
                <p>It’s rare that someone playing for the Knicks, one of the NBA’s biggest markets, is underrated, but I think that might be the case for Jalen Brunson. The 6-2 point guard was the driving force behind New York’s 108-105 overtime win against the Celtics in game 1, scoring 29 points on 5-9 shooting from beyond the arc. Brunson showed why he was the 2025 Clutch Player of the Year down the stretch, draining multiple contested triples late in the 4th to steal the first game of the series on the road.</p>

                <h3>Don’t Forget About Nikola Jokić</h3>
                
                <p>Aaron Gordon’s game-winning three will probably garner most of the attention from last night’s stunning 121-119 Nuggets win, but Nikola Jokić’s ridiculous performance shouldn’t be forgotten. The Serbian superstar stuffed the stat sheet, finishing with 42 points (15-29 FG), 22 rebounds, 6 assists, and 2 blocks. It feels like the basketball community is taking Jokić’s greatness for granted, and last night was a much-needed reminder he’s still the best player in the world.</p>

				  <p>There have been a lot of shocking results over the last couple of days in the NBA, but yesterday’s Nuggets-Thunder game probably surprised me the most. Oklahoma City’s looked invincible all season long, yet they crumbled down the stretch on both ends. I understand the duo of Jokić and Jamal Murray is difficult to contain, but it really felt to me like OKC shot themselves in the foot with their late game execution.</p>
