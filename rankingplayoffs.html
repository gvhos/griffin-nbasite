            <p style="font-size: 1.1em">This year’s NBA Playoffs have been extremely exciting with a lot of upsets, close games, and star performances. However, despite all the unpredictability, one thing always remains true in the NBA: stars win games in the playoffs. The team with the best player usually comes out on top in a 7 game series, despite all the other factors at play. With that in mind, who are the best players remaining in the Conference Finals? Here’s my top 5:  </p>
            
            <div class="history-fact" style="background-color:#9ea2a2">
                <span class="fact-number">5</span>
                <img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9zK5PmnBwB0R6DImhR3.5w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTY0MDtoPTQyNztjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/athlon_sports_articles_610/a63d1afea1889ed8a10c11d14e277d8b" alt="Randle" class="fact-image">
                <h3 class="fact-title">Julius Randle (Timberwolves)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">6 months ago, Julius Randle being on this list would’ve been crazy, however the 30-year-old has reinvented himself these playoffs. Randle has put up over 24 points a contest with the Wolves in the postseason, shooting a respectable 39.3% from beyond the arc on 5.5 attempts per night. He’s been the perfect second option to pair next to Anthony Edwards, with the duo taking down both the Lakers and Warriors already. Can Minnesota defeat the 68-win Thunder? Randle’s performance will likely be the answer to that question. </p>

            <div class="history-fact" style="background-color: #FDBB30">
                <span class="fact-number">4</span>
                <img src="https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/crop_style_16_9_desktop/s3/2024-05/Tyrese%20Haliburton%20050724_0.jpeg?h=920929c4&itok=cv0GvgWc" alt="Hali" class="fact-image">
                <h3 class="fact-title">Tyrese Haliburton (Pacers)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Tyrese Haliburton has been on a mission these playoffs to prove that the Pacers Eastern Conference Finals run last season wasn’t a fluke. After being voted the “most overrated” player by his peers a few months ago, Hali has silenced every critic this past month. He’s averaging 17.5 PPG and 9.3 APG during the 2024-25 playoffs, and is probably not done yet. As the engine of a high-powered Pacers offense, Tyrese has Indiana on the brink of their first NBA Finals since 2000. </p>

            <div class="history-fact" style="background-color: #2870A8">
                <span class="fact-number">3</span>
                <img src="https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AP24101070255806.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900" alt = "Edwards" class="fact-image">
                <h3 class="fact-title">Anthony Edwards (Timberwolves)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Anthony Edwards is one of the most marketable stars in the entire NBA, and for good reason. Ant out-dueled LeBron James and Luka Doncic in round one, before dominating Jimmy Butler in round two. The 23-year-old is well on his way to being the future face of the league, as he’s averaging 25.7 PPG in the playoffs while also playing excellent defense. An often overlooked part of Edwards' game is his ability to distribute the ball; he’s taken massive leaps in that regard this year, dishing out nearly 6 assists a night in the postseason. It’s hard not to be optimistic about the Wolves' future if they have Edwards leading them.</p>

            <div class="history-fact" style="background-color: #F58426">
                <span class="fact-number">2</span>
                <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/HKQIGB2UCFODVG7WBFVEQNUW5Y.jpg" alt="Brunson" class="fact-image">
                <h3 class="fact-title">Jalen Brunson (Knicks)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Jalen Brunson’s rise to stardom has been well-documented before the 2024-25 playoffs, but the 28-year-old has cemented himself among the greats with this recent run. He’s averaging a ridiculous 28.8 PPG and 7.7 APG, despite being at the top of every opponent’s scouting report. Jalen also showed why he won the 2025 NBA Clutch Player of the Year; the Villanova product has had multiple very clutch performances in this year’s playoffs. Ultimately, if I need someone to take the final shot in a close game, I’m choosing Brunson and not thinking twice.</p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Thunder)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Set to be announced the MVP on Wednesday, Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is undoubtedly the best player in the entire world. Shai has experienced some growing pains this postseason, but he is still averaging 29.2 PPG on 57.3% TS%. Defensively, Gilgeous-Alexander also makes a massive impact, as he often holds his own when tasked with guarding opposing stars. Shai leads all players left in the playoffs in PPG, a stat that shows his otherworldly scoring ability compared to the rest of the league. Putting SGA in the #1 spot on this list was an easy decision.
