            <div class="article-intro" style="font-size: 1.1em">
                <p>The Philadelphia 76ers have a pivotal offseason ahead, as multiple key contributors from last season will become free agents this July. Which guys should the team prioritize keeping and who should they let go? Below, I detail my thoughts on some Sixers free agents and if the team should re-sign them or allow them to walk in free agency. 

</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- First section -->
            <div class="article-section">
                <h3>Quentin Grimes</h3>
				<h3 style="color: red">Verdict: Re-sign</h3>
                
                <p>In a recent season full of disappointments, Quentin Grimes was a major silver lining for the Sixers. After acquiring Grimes at the trade deadline for Caleb Martin and a second-round pick, a lot of Philadelphia fans had high expectations for the 25-year-old. Even Grimes’ biggest fans, though, were probably surprised by how well the Houston product played under Nick Nurse. During the second half of the season, Quentin put up a career-high 21.9 PPG on 37.3% shooting from deep. </p>
                
                
                <p>Grimes will be a restricted free agent, meaning Philadelphia can match whatever offers he receives in free agency. Considering the cap situation for most other teams around the NBA, the 76ers shouldn’t have a problem getting Grimes back on a reasonable contract. Even if a team with a lot of cap room — such as Brooklyn Nets — offers Grimes a large deal, Philadelphia should make it a priority to match it because of how good Quentin was down the stretch.  </p>
                
                
                <!-- Example image with caption -->

            </div>
            
            <!-- Second section -->
            <div class="article-section">
                <h3>Kyle Lowry</h3>
				<h3 style="color: red">Verdict: Let him leave </h3>
                
                <p>At his peak, Kyle Lowry was undoubtedly a player Sixers fans would’ve loved to root for. Even today, Lowry is an incredible leader that plays with ferocious intensity every minute he’s on the court. However, at 38-years-old, Lowry’s athleticism and scoring ability have deteriorated to a point where it’s hard to justify bringing him back. </p>
				
				
               <img src="https://975thefanatic.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2149918371_1720798475_.jpg?format=auto&optimize=high&width=1440" alt="Example image" class="article-image" style="max-height: 330px">
				
                <p>Even putting his current on-court abilities to the side, Kyle simply hasn’t been healthy enough for Nick Nurse’s squad to count on. Over these past two seasons, Lowry’s missed nearly 70 games while only appearing in 95 contests. Plus, even when he has played, the veteran has struggled to both shoot the ball and move laterally on the defensive end. KLow made a mere 33.0% of his triples last season, his worst mark since 2010. If Lowry wants to become an assistant coach, that’s fine, but otherwise his playing days need to be done. </p>
            </div>
            
			 <div class="article-section">
                <h3>Guerschon Yabusele</h3>
				<h3 style="color: red">Verdict: Re-sign </h3>
                
                <p>From Caleb Martin, to Reggie Jackson, to Andre Drummond, Sixers President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey made a lot of questionable signings last offseason. One signing that worked out well, though, was Guerschon Yabusele on a minimum contract. The Frenchman averaged 11.0 PPG and connected on 38% of his threes during the 2024-25 campaign. </p>
				
				
               <img src="https://cdn.nba.com/manage/2025/01/GettyImages-2193027241-1-scaled.jpg" alt="Example image" class="article-image" style="max-height: 330px">
				
                <p>One of the main reasons Philadelphia should prioritize bringing Yabusele back is the 6-8 forward’s great fit next to Joel Embiid. Yabu can both space the floor and score efficiently around the rim when Embiid needs to take a possession off. Add in his defensive versatility and constant hustle on both ends, and it’s easy to see how Guerschon quickly became a fan favorite last year. Bringing back both him and Grimes might be hard, but the 76ers need to do everything in their power to make sure Yabu stays in the red-white-and-blue next season. </p>
            </div>
            
            
            <!-- Conclusion section -->
            <div class="article-section conclusion" style="font-size: 1.1em">
                
                <p>Ultimately, the 76ers front office will have a lot of important choices to make this offseason, beyond just the three I mentioned here. However, if the team wants to improve their position for next year, bringing back both Grimes and Yabusele while letting Lowry leave would be a perfect start. </p>
