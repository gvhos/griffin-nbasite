                Published: May 7, 2025 | Author: Griffin Bond
            </div>
            
            <p>While most NBA experts and fans alike spend the bulk of their time looking at the top prospects in a draft class, it’s also important to consider the players farther down the board. From Tyrese Maxey, to Pascal Siakam, to Rudy Gobert, many guys have become All-Stars despite being drafted outside the lottery. Which late first-round picks could be steals this year? I have four names:</p>
            
            <div class="steal-card" style="background-color: #A4C8E1">
                <div class="steal-header">
                    <div class="steal-number">1</div>
                    <div>
                        <h3 class="player-name">Liam McNeely</h3>
                        <div class="player-details">UConn | SF | 6'7" | 210 lbs</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <img src="https://www.zagsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/McNeeley.jpg" alt="Liam McNeely" class="steal-image">
                
                <p>At first glance, McNeely’s stats don’t look great, especially considering the fact that he’s known as a shooter. The 6-7 wing only connected on 31.7% of his threes during his lone season at UConn, a mark well below what you’d expect from someone of his archetype. However, I think there are still reasons to believe in McNeely.</p>
                
                <div class="why-steal" style="background-color: #6DA5CF">
                    <strong>Why He Could Be a Steal:</strong> Prospects McNeely’s size with his feel for the game don’t grow on trees. The 19-year-old is a solid connective passer, and he’s not afraid to find the open teammate when needed. McNeely needs to improve defensively, but considering his 6-9 wingspan, he’s got a solid base to work with. Assuming the shot returns to form at the NBA level, there are reasons to be very optimistic about the UConn product’s professional outlook.

                    <div class="steal-number">2</div>
                    <div>
                        <h3 class="player-name">Nique Clifford</h3>
                        <div class="player-details" style="color: black">Colorado State | SG | 6'5" | 175 lbs</div>
                    </div>

                <p>Clifford is one of, if not my favorite, prospects in the 2025 NBA Draft class. He led a Colorado State team with questionable talent to a 26-10 record last season, finishing first on the team in scoring with 18.9 PPG. Clifford—currently 23 years old—will be much older than the average first-round pick, but he makes up for his age with an NBA-ready skill set.</p>
                
                <div class="why-steal" style="background-color: #43AF62">
                    <strong>Why He Could Be a Steal:</strong> Excluding Cooper Flagg, Clifford might be the most well-rounded prospect in this class. He’s a menace on the defensive end with a lot of savviness, posting impressive 2.0 STL and BLK% rates in 2024-25. Offensively, Clifford is a reliable shooter (37.7% 3PT%) and a ferocious driver (5.0 FTA) that finds creative ways to score nearly every possession. Add in the fact that he’s a ridiculous rebounder for his size (9.6 RPG), and it’s hard not to be tantalized by Nique Clifford.

                        <h3 class="player-name">Yaxel Lendeborg</h3>
                        <div class="player-details">UAB | PF | 6'9" | 230 lbs</div>

                <p>Look as hard as you want. You will not find a more unique prospect in the 2025 class than Yaxel Lendeborg. Despite being 6-9, 230 pounds, UAB tasked Lendeborg with point-forward responsibilities this past season. The 22-year-old handled them well, finishing the year with averages of 17.7 PPG, 11.4 RPG, and 4.2 APG.</p>
                
                <div class="why-steal" style="background-color: #FFAD03">
                    <strong>Why He Could Be a Steal:</strong>  Lendeborg does it all. He was the offensive hub for UAB last year, both distributing and scoring the ball at a very high level. Lendeborg has great footwork in the post and he’s also a competent outside shooter, posting a 35.7% 3P% during the 24-25 campaign. Oh, and did I mention he led the AAC in rebounds per game? Plus, Lendeborg’s defense is quite impressive. I’m sold.

                        <h3 class="player-name">Thomas Sorber</h3>
                        <div class="player-details">Georgetown | C | 6'10" | 255 lbs</div>
                    </div>

                <p>Thomas Sorber isn’t the most exciting type of prospect, but sometimes it pays dividends to take the safe option. Sorber put up 14.5 PPG, 8.5 RPG, and 2.0 BPG for Georgetown last year before a left foot injury cut his campaign short. The 6-10 big man has a solid foundation to build on, with the potential to become something special since he’s only 19 years old.</p>
                
                <div class="why-steal" style="background-color: #4F7BBA">
                    <strong>Why He Could Be a Steal:</strong> Sorber does everything you want a traditional center at the NBA level to do. He’s a strong finisher around the rim, a willing screener, and a bouncy rim protector. However, it’s Sorber’s passing skills that intrigue me the most. He processes the game at a really high level for someone his size, often spraying the ball out to open shooters after corralling an offensive rebound. If the Georgetown product can make shrewd passes at the NBA level, he’s got all the makings of a double digit year career.
