            <p style="font-size: 1.1em">The 2025 NBA playoffs have been very unpredictable, as we’ve seen a lot of upsets in both the Eastern and Western Conference. Most basketball analysts expected the 1 seed Oklahoma City Thunder to be in this position, however the Minnesota Timberwolves, New York Knicks, and Indiana Pacers have all made surprisingly deep runs this postseason as well. No matter what happens, one of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Tyrese Haliburton, Anthony Edwards, or Jalen Brunson will win their first ring. Pretty cool, right? But in order to win the finals, you first have to make it there. Here are my predictions for the conference finals: </p>
            
            <div class="series-prediction" style="background-color: #FDBB30">
                <div class="matchup">(3) New York Knicks vs. (4) Indiana Pacers</div>
                <div class="prediction-details">
                    <span class="prediction-outcome">Pacers in 6</span>
                </div>
                <div class="analysis">
                    <p>This series should be an entertaining one, as Tyrese Haliburton and Jalen Brunson are two of the most exciting young guards in the entire NBA. Both are amid arguably their best playoff runs yet, making this pick quite hard for me. The Pacers play a fast-paced, egalitarian style of basketball; they’re averaging by far the most assists per game in the playoffs (29.7). Instead of turning the game into a track meet, the Knicks will beat you down in a fist fight; they’ve drawn 22.1 fouls a game these playoffs, the most out of any team. Which of these distinct styles will prevail?</p>

					<p>It’s not an easy decision, but I’ve got Indiana winning in 6 games. My confidence in the Pacers stems from my trust in Tyrese Haliburton; I think the All-Star guard is the perfect player to lead a team to the finals. Halliburton makes the right play nearly every possession, as he’s sporting an unheard of 4.43 postseason assist-turnover ratio. Haliburton also averaged 17.4 PPG against the Cavs in round 2, alongside Pascal Siakam, Myles Turner, and a band of high-level role players. Don’t get it twisted, The Knicks have their own star power and depth, but I’m not sure if they can overcome Indiana’s elite three-point shooting. If they’re not getting as many foul calls as before, can the Knicks offense keep up with the Pacers? I’m not sold.

                <div class="analysis">
                    <p>I can’t get a read on this series, and I keep switching around my prediction. The Thunder were a regular season juggernaut—winning a league-high 68 games—but they’ve looked mortal over the last couple of weeks, barely squeaking by the Denver Nuggets in 7 games. Anthony Edwards and the Timberwolves won only 49 games in the regular season, although they’re arguably the hottest team in basketball as of late. Chris Finch’s squad shocked the NBA community by beating both the Lakers and the Warriors, who’s to say they can’t do it again?  </p>

					<p>Ultimately, I’ve got the Thunder winning the series in 7 games. When in doubt, go with the team that has the best player, which is undoubtedly OKC. Shai will probably win the MVP award for a reason, as he’s had some incredible performances in both the regular season and playoffs. The Wolves are an excellent defensive team, but I don’t think they have any great answers for Gilgeous-Alexander; he scored an efficient 37 and 39 points versus them in back-to-back late February games. Plus, OKC has superb depth around their stars, with Alex Caruso, Cason Wallace, and Isaiah Hartenstein all coming up big in different situations. The Thunder will win a close series.</p>

           <div class="article-section conclusion">
                
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">At the end of the day, both of these series could go either way. In two weeks, the Knicks and Timberwolves may cause me to look very dumb. However, after closely examining both series, I feel confident planting my flag with the Pacers and Thunder.
