            <div class="article-intro">
                <p>The Philadelphia 76ers enter next Monday’s draft lottery with the 5th best odds to land the number 1 pick and the privilege of taking Cooper Flagg. Flagg—one of the most well-rounded players we’ve seen in the last decade—would completely change the calculus of Philadelphia’s franchise. The Sixers also have a 10.5% chance of landing the number 2 selection, a situation where they would undoubtedly take Dylan Harper out of Rutgers. Harper, like Flagg, is a transformative prospect. However, while either Flagg or Harper would be nice to have Philadelphia, the team is much more likely to have a pick outside the top 2. In that case, who should President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey consider selecting? I have two intriguing names:

                <h3>Kon Knueppel</h3>
                
                <p>While most draft experts have focused their attention on definite number one pick Cooper Flagg, his Duke teammate Kon Knueppel deserves some love as well. Knueppel was Duke’s second leading scorer last season, and he played a major role in the Blue Devils run to the Final Four. The 6-7 wing is one of the best scorers in the class, as he averaged 14.4 PPG on 47.9/40.6/91.4% shooting splits during the 23-24 campaign. He’s got a knack for knocking down difficult shots off the catch with a hand in his face. Beyond scoring, Knueppel’s basketball IQ is sky high and he has an excellent feel for the game. When you watch the 19-year-old play, he already seems mature beyond his years. </p>
                
                
                <p>While Daryl Morey has been insistent that he’ll draft the best player available instead of looking at fit, it’s still important to consider how someone like Knueppel will look next to a fully healthy Sixers squad. Thankfully, I think the Duke product would be an excellent young piece for Philadelphia to pair next to a trio of Joel Embiid, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey. We’ve seen Embiid have success next to skilled three-point shooters like J.J. Redick and Seth Curry, and I believe Knueppel could be next in the line of players that took their game to the next level after playing with Philly’s superstar big man. If he’s available mid-lottery, the Sixers front office must consider selecting Kon Knueppel. </p>

                <h3>Collin Murray-Boyles</h3>
                
                <p>South Carolina power forward Collin Murray-Boyles is a prospect that experts should link more heavily to the Sixers. Murray-Boyles is on the older side for a lottery pick—he’ll be 20 on draft night—but he was incredibly productive in college. Offensively, Murray-Boyles led the SEC with a FG% of 58.6% and an eFG% of 59.9%. He’s got incredible footwork in the post and is an extremely creative passer, all prerequisites for a non-shooting big in the modern NBA. But while his offense is solid, Murray-Boyles truly shines on the other side of the ball. Collin has some of the best hands in the 2025 draft class, allowing him to average 1.5 SPG and 1.3 BPG last year. Combine that with his versatility and ferocious intensity and there’s a lot to like.</p>

                <p>What would Murray-Boyles’ role be on the 76ers? The answer isn’t obvious, but I’d look to Guerschon Yabusele as an example of how someone the South Carolina product’s size can thrive in Philadelphia’s ecosystem. Yabu’s obviously a better shooter than Murray-Boyles—the 20-year-old shot a mere 26.5% from three last season—however there are clear similarities between the two. Just like Yabusele, Murray-Boyles is a burly power forward that mainly operates from the post. Both are also impactful defenders with a high feel for the game. Considering how well Guerschon worked next to Joel Embiid, the Sixers could recreate that pairing by drafting Murray-Boyles.</p>

                <p>Ultimately, regardless of who the Sixers select, they’ll be in a good spot next year. However, by taking either Knueppel or Murray-Boyles, Philadelphia could drastically elevate their ceiling.</p>
