            <p>From Wilt Chamberlain, to Larry Bird, to Michael Jordan, the NBA is a league rooted in rich tradition. But while most people know about the stars and major stories of the past, not everyone is aware of some of the interesting anecdotes from the NBA's earliest days. Here are five little-known historical NBA facts:  </p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">Air Jordans Were Once Banned</h3>
                <p>During the 1980s, the NBA banned the now iconic Air Jordan shoes. While Michael Jordan continued to wear his signature sneakers, the league fined him $5000 each game he did so, a hefty price back in the day. The NBA’s ban was based on the ruling that shoes "worn by athletes must be 51% white and must match the shoes worn by their team colors.” Air Jordan’s did not meet this requirement, meaning they were outlawed by commissioner David Stern. Eventually, the shoes were unbanned, and they’re now one of the most well-known basketball kicks ever. </p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">There Were Two Teams Named The Hawks In The Same Season</h3>
                <p>During the 1949-50 season, the Tri-Cities Blackhawks and Waterloo Hawks both played in the same league. Tri-Cities was the better team, finishing with a 29-35 record compared to Waterloo's 19-43 mark. The Blackhawks relocated to Milwaukee in 1951, while the Waterloo Hawks were dropped from the NBA in 1950. Today, the Atlanta Hawks are a continuation of the Tri-Cities Blackhawks franchise. </p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">The Longest NBA Game Lasted Three Months</h3>
                <p>In November of 1978, the Sixers beat the Nets in a thrilling double overtime game. However, referee Richie Powers handed out a slew of questionable technical fouls to the Nets in the third quarter, causing them to protest the game to the league. The NBA agreed and the both teams played the final 18 minutes of the game three months later. Multiple players that were on the 76ers in November were traded to the Nets in February, meaning they technically played for two teams in one game.</p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">The NBA Once Used A Jump Ball After Every Basket</h3>
                <p>In the earliest year's of the NBA, the league had a jump ball at center court after every made basket. This rule made the pace of games much slower, as the teams had to keep moving back to the middle of the court. Eventually, the NBA introduced inbounding the ball after a basket, as we know today.</p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">NBA Star Pete Maravich Predicted His Death</h3>
                <p>During an interview while he was still playing in 1974, NBA superstar Pete Maravich stated, “I don’t want to play 10 years in the NBA and die of a heart attack at 40.” 14 years later, in 1988, Maravich died of a heart attack at age 40 while playing a pickup game. It was later found that Maravich had a rare heart defect, causing his death at a young age.</p>
