            <p style="font-size: 1.1em">While the fate of all 14 lottery teams will be decided tonight, all NBA fans will have their eyes on one thing: which team gets the #1 pick and the right to draft Cooper Flagg. Flagg—one of the best prospects we’ve seen in years—projects to be a staple on the NBA’s All-Defensive teams for years and a perennial 20 PPG scorer. Whichever franchise gets him will be transformed for years to come, while the others may remain stuck at the bottom of the standings.  </p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">Toronto Raptors</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">The Raptors would benefit a lot from the chance to take Cooper Flagg if they land the #1 pick. Toronto—led by Scottie Barnes and R.J. Barrett—finished 30-52 last year, 11th in the Eastern Conference. Even after acquiring Brandon Ingram at the trade deadline, the Raptors still lack a true star, meaning Flagg would slot in perfectly. The Duke product would be the perfect guy to lead this next era of Raptors basketball. </p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">Brooklyn Nets</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Looking around the NBA, it’s hard to find a team with less talent than the Brooklyn Nets. Jordi Fernandez’ squad won a mere 26 games last year, stumbling to a 4-15 record over their last 19 contests. Cam Johnson, Nic Claxton, and Cam Thomas are arguably the only long-term pieces Brooklyn has, none of which project to be the first option on a contender. Cooper Flagg would change that in a heartbeat. </p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">Charlotte Hornets</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">The Hornets have been one of the worst teams in the NBA for years now, as they have the longest active playoff drought in the NBA. LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller have both shown some promise, but the Hornets need to surround them with more talent in order to make a playoff push in the future. Flagg and Ball would instantly become one of the most electric duos in the entire NBA, and Hornets fans would be rewarded for all the suffering they’ve endured over the past 10 years. I like this landing spot.</p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">Utah Jazz</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Ever since Danny Ainge took over as the Jazz President of Basketball Operations a couple of years ago, Utah has been building towards getting someone like Flagg. At 17-65, Utah finished with the worst record in the NBA last year, in large part because they want to draft a generational prospect. The NBA is a stars league, and Cooper Flagg would instantly lift the Jazz from a team with a murky outlook to one of the most exciting young squads.</p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">Washington Wizards</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Considering all the suffering the Wizards have gone through over the past 3 years, it only makes sense for me to give them the #1 spot on this list. The Wizards haven’t made the Eastern Conference Finals since 1979 because they’ve been committed to being average instead of rebuilding. After finally embracing a rebuild, I can think of no better way for Washington to kick-start this new era than by getting Cooper Flagg. Flagg, paired next to Alex Sarr and Jordan Poole, would be a really fun trio for years to come.</p>
