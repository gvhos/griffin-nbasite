            <h2>Prospects The Philadelphia 76ers Should Consider With The 35th Pick</h2>
            
            <div class="article-meta" style="font-style: italic">
                Published: May 22, 2025 | Author: Griffin Bond
            </div>
            
            <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Most Sixers fans and NBA analysts have spent their time breaking down what Philadelphia should do with the 3rd pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, however the team also has an early 2nd rounder. Considering the fact that the 76ers have drafted valuable contributors such as Adem Bona, Paul Reed, and Isaiah Joe in the 2nd round before, we shouldn’t overlook the value of this selection. There are a lot of interesting prospects projected to go past pick 30, but which ones should President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey look at? Here are some guys I’d consider:
 </p>
            
            <div class="history-fact" style="background-color:#E44B4B">
                <span class="fact-number">1</span>
                <img src="https://trashtalk.co/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fredac.trashtalk.co%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F02%2FMaxime-Raynaud-3-decembre-2024.jpg&w=3840&q=75" alt="Maxime" class="fact-image">
                <h3 class="fact-title">Maxime Raynaud (Stanford)</h3>
				
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">If the Sixers want to go the backup center route with this pick, Maxime Raynaud makes a bunch of sense. The 7-1 big man had an excellent draft combine, impressing in the scrimmage and testing great in the athleticism drills. Raynaud is an intriguing prospect because he possesses rare scoring ability for someone his size; Maxime put up 20.2 PPG last year on over 34% shooting from three. The 22-year-old could immediately help the Sixers, especially if Joel Embiid remains sidelined with an injury. I’d take a long look at him with pick 35.  </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="history-fact" style="background-color: #4B9CD3">
                <span class="fact-number">2</span>
                <img src="https://images.rivals.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,t_large/izywbvpyylgpovlcwoek" alt="Drake Powell" class="fact-image">
                <h3 class="fact-title">Drake Powell (North Carolina)</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Just like Raynaud, wing Drake Powell is rapidly rising up draft boards after a productive combine. Powell’s measurables were solid, standing at 6-5.25 barefoot and weighing in at over 200 pounds. Drake is your prototypical 3-and-D wing, not the flashiest player, but you know exactly what you’re getting from him. The UNC product shot nearly 38% from beyond the arc and grabbed 0.7 steals and blocks per contest. Add in a relentless motor and defensive switchability, and it’s easy to see why the Sixers might take Powell.  </p>

            <div class="history-fact" style="background-color: #DE2742">
                <span class="fact-number">3</span>
                <img src="https://www.sdsu.edu/news/2024/11/images/sdsu-byrd-ucsd-vijas-arena.webp" alt = "Byrd" class="fact-image">
                <h3 class="fact-title">Miles Byrd (San Diego State)</h3>
				
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Miles Byrd is one of the most fun players to watch in the 2025 draft, and I’d think he’d be a steal for Philadelphia with the 35th pick. Byrd is an absolutely incredible defender, averaging over 2 SPG for SDSU during his sophomore season. The 20-year-old has a questionable jumper (30
% from three) but his defense alone makes him draftable. If Philadelphia was to select Byrd, he’d be a nice piece to pair next to two offensive-minded guards in Jared McCain and Quentin Grimes. </p>

            <div class="history-fact" style="background-color: #FFCC00">
                <span class="fact-number">4</span>
                <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KguU1MktiEgLoM_1T2dmIrO1UAE=/0x0:2400x3600/1200x800/filters:focal(862x730:1246x1114)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/72813288/1473801448.0.jpg" alt="Kam" class="fact-image">
                <h3 class="fact-title">Kam Jones (Marquette)</h3>
				
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">Shot-creation is king in the modern NBA, and Kam Jones is one of the most advanced scorers that will be available in the 2nd round. Jones was born to put the ball in the hoop, averaging 17.1 PPG on 48.2/36.1/67.6% shooting splits his last 3 years in college. He’s also developing some high-level playmaking skills, as Jones dished out a career-high 5.9 APG last season compared to just 1.9 TOVPG. The defense and smaller frame make Kam a questionable fit on the 76ers already guard-heavy roster, but they should consider the 23-year-old because of his NBA-ready skillset. </p>

                <h3 class="fact-title">Hugo Gonzalez (Real Madrid)</h3>
			
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">On one hand, Real Madrid wing Hugo Gonzalez is a prospect with a raw game and a lot of questions. He barely played for Madrid, coming off the bench most nights. He has a very questionable jumper, hitting just 33% of his triples during EuroLeague play. However, on the other hand, Gonzalez is one of the best defensive prospects that will be available in the second round. He plays with a relentless motor, consistently racking up both steals and blocks. Offensively, Gonzalez is at his best when he’s attacking the rim with his lengthy 6-6 frame. He’s got a long way to go, but Hugo Gonzalez deserves a long look at pick 35.

                <p><div class="article-section conclusion">
                
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em">At the end of the day, the 76ers probably won’t pick any of the prospects I mentioned above 35th overall. However, if they select one of these prospects, they’ll be well-situated for next year and the long-term future.
